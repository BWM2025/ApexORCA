© 2026 ApexORCA.io — All rights reserved. Founder: B.W. Moore

1. Always run agents on your own hardware (local only).
2. Review SAFETY.md in every persona before use.
3. Use phase gates and never give unrestricted tool access.
4. Monitor HEARTBEAT logs nightly.
5. For high-risk tasks, use human approval step.
