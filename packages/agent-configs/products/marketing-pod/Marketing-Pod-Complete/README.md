# Marketing Pod — Autonomous Marketing That Moves the Needle

**Your autonomous marketing director that never sleeps, never drifts, and actually moves the needle.**

Stop writing endless content yourself. Stop hoping random AI posts convert. You now have a full **Marketing Pod** — governed, traceable, and relentlessly focused on turning strangers into paying customers while you sleep.

Raw AI gives creativity and speed. OpenClaw gives persistent memory and real execution (posting, emailing, analytics). Governance gives structure, brand safety, and continuous improvement. Together they become your dedicated Marketing Pod.

## Short Install User Guide (get running in minutes)

1. **Extract the ZIP** to any folder on your machine.
2. **Run the installer:** Open Terminal, `cd` into the extracted folder, then run:  
   `bash setup.sh`  
   (Or double-click `setup.sh` if your OS allows.)
3. **Restart OpenClaw** (or your agent gateway).  
   Example (macOS):  
   `launchctl kickstart -k gui/$(id -u)/ai.openclaw.gateway`
4. **In WhatsApp (or your chat interface),** message your **Marketing-Lead** with a **short mandate** (1–2 sentences).  
   Example: *"Run HEARTBEAT and send me this week’s performance brief"* or *"Create and queue the next 5 posts for [channel]."*
5. **Done.** The Marketing Pod is now running autonomously. You only send short mandates; you get spot-check briefs when you choose.

For full step-by-step instructions, zero-cost WhatsApp setup, and troubleshooting, see **INSTALL.md**.

## ORCA governance (how this pod runs)

This pod runs with **ORCA** as **hidden middleware**: the agent creates/updates a traceability matrix and runs phase-locked steps internally; you see natural, conversational replies. Matrix, phases, and Trust Meter are not shown in every response — only when you ask (e.g. *"Show Trust Meter"* or *"Run ORCA audit"*). On deviation the agent responds in plain language (e.g. "Can't do that — risk too high") and notifies the founder. For the matrix schema and halt format, see shared **ORCA_MATRIX_AND_HALT_TEMPLATE.md** and **docs/ORCA_CORE_REFERENCE.md**.

## What You Have

- **Marketing-Lead** persona folder — ready to drop into OpenClaw (you can rename to `[YourName]-Lead` if you prefer).
- All **shared governance protocols** the Marketing role needs (reversibility tiers, daily report format, email protocol, content/distribution boundary).
- **Pre-configured memory** and traceability starter.
- **3 key diagrams** (Three-Component Merge, Universal Governance Phases, Growth Flywheel) in the `Diagrams/` folder.
- **Quickstart** founder rules and example short mandates in `Quickstart/`.
- **Lifetime updates** to this Marketing Pod configuration when you re-download from your account.

Everything is pre-built and governed. Install once and the pod starts creating and distributing content autonomously while staying fully aligned with your brand.

## Founder Rule (non-negotiable)

**Short mandates only.** Message your Marketing-Lead with 1–2 sentences. The pod runs marketing; you get spot-check reports only when you decide. No daily novels. This is how you get real marketing agency with minimal founder time.

See `Quickstart/FOUNDER_RULES.md` and `Quickstart/EXAMPLE_SHORT_MANDATES.md` for examples.
