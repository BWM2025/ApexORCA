# PRODUCT_SHEET.md — Marketing Pod (Echo)

**Product Name**: Marketing Pod  
**Purpose**: Autonomous marketing agent for content generation, outreach (posts/DMs/emails), follower growth, contests, and sales amplification.

**Key Specs (From Codebase)**

- Role: Content creation, outreach, profile optimization (Echo).
- Tools: message (DMs/emails), exec (post_tweet_env.sh, send_email_resend.ts), web_search/fetch (leads), browser (profiles).
- Files: personas/echo/ (HEARTBEAT.md, IDENTITY.md, SAFETY.md, TOOLS.md, PHASES.md, RHYTHMS.md, SOUL.md), X_POSTING_PROTOCOL.md.
- Governance: REVERSIBILITY_TIERS.md, VETO_PROTOCOL.md, ORCA hidden middleware, ECHO_SONAR_BOUNDARY.md.

**Integration Mechanics (AI + OpenClaw + ORCA)**

- Raw AI: Reasoning for content (CoT drafts), adaptation (from feedback).
- OpenClaw: message for DMs/emails, exec for posting, web_search for leads.
- ORCA Middleware: Hidden traceability matrix (tracks campaigns), internal phase gating (scrape → leads → DMs → audit), silent halts on risk, Trust Meter on request, compliance auto-checked (GDPR-safe DMs).
- Result: Traceable, safe marketing — defeats drift (matrix), maximizes engagement (custom phases), no visible structure.

**ORCA Value (Why Second to None)**

- Hidden governance ensures auditable campaigns, self-learning from logs, intuitive targeting.
- Example: Generates posts/DMs internally (phase-gated), checks compliance silently, reports naturally ("Campaign live, 500 DMs sent").
- Certification: Run orca_certification_audit (or equivalent) for "ORCA Certified" marketing.

**Principles/Objectives (From Constitution)**

- Defeat weaknesses: Matrix/halts for drift-free outreach.
- Maximize strengths: Custom phases for marketing (scrape → leads → DMs → audit).
- Enable revolution: Governed marketing for real sales.
