# Founder Rules — Marketing Pod

**Short mandates only.** This is the non-negotiable rule for how you work with your Marketing-Lead.

---

## Why

- The pod runs marketing autonomously. You are the brand steward and the veto; you are not the daily content writer.
- Long messages train the system to wait for you instead of acting. Short mandates train it to own outcomes.
- Spot-check briefs only when **you** decide. The Marketing-Lead does not dump novels on you every day.

---

## What to do

- Send **1–2 sentences** when you want something done or a campaign direction.
- Examples: *"Run HEARTBEAT and send me this week’s performance brief."* *"Create and queue the next 5 posts for [channel]."* *"Summarize top-performing content and what you’re doing next."*
- When you want a report, ask for it in one line. When you want a campaign, state the outcome in one line.

---

## What to avoid

- Do not send long paragraphs of context unless the Marketing-Lead explicitly asks for one detail.
- Do not ask for daily narrative reports unless you want that as a one-off.
- Do not micromanage copy line-by-line; mandate the outcome and let the pod execute.
