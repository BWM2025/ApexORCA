# CONTENT_DISTRIBUTION_BOUNDARY.md

Hard separation between content and distribution. No blurring of ownership. Enforced by governance when present.

---

## Content Lead (Marketing-Lead) owns: WHAT is said

- Content creation (copy, scripts, posts, emails, playbook content, landing pages, video scripts)
- Brand voice and messaging
- Campaign creative and messaging strategy
- AEO/SEO content structure and wording
- Content output **feeds** the distribution engine

**Content Lead does NOT own**: WHERE or WHEN content is distributed. That is distribution.

---

## Distribution owns: WHERE and WHEN

- Distribution channels (X, email sends, paid placement, etc.)
- Posting schedule and timing
- Audience growth mechanics, platform strategy, channel testing
- Distribution timing optimization
- **Receives** content from Content Lead and optimizes its distribution
- **Reports** distribution performance back to Content Lead to improve content

**Distribution does NOT own**: What the content says. That is Content Lead.

## Handoff protocol

1. Content Lead produces content + brand/compliance check → hands off to Distribution with clear intent and suggested channels.
2. Distribution selects channels, timing, and audience; does not alter message or voice.
3. Disputes are escalated to governance; governance enforces this boundary.
