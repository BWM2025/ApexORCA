# Growth Engine — Your Autonomous Distribution & Growth Layer

**Your autonomous Growth Engine that finds the right audiences, times posts perfectly, and turns attention into revenue — while you focus on the product.**

Stop guessing when to post. Stop watching great content disappear into the void. Stop doing manual distribution work that never scales. You now have a full **Growth Engine** — governed, traceable, and obsessively focused on getting the right eyes on your offer at the right time.

Raw AI gives smart targeting and messaging ideas. OpenClaw gives persistent memory, real posting tools, and cross-platform execution. Governance gives structure, brand safety, performance self-audit, and continuous optimization. Together they become your dedicated Growth Engine.

## Short Install User Guide (get running in minutes)

1. **Extract the ZIP** to any folder on your machine.
2. **Run the installer:** Open Terminal, `cd` into the extracted folder, then run:  
   `bash setup.sh`  
   (Or double-click `setup.sh` if your OS allows.)
3. **Restart OpenClaw** (or your agent gateway).  
   Example (macOS):  
   `launchctl kickstart -k gui/$(id -u)/ai.openclaw.gateway`
4. **In WhatsApp (or your chat interface),** message your **Growth-Lead** with a **short mandate**.  
   Example: *"Run your first audience research and posting schedule for our new offer"* or *"Run HEARTBEAT and give me the growth brief."*
5. **Done.** The Growth Engine is now running autonomously. You only send short mandates; you get spot-check briefs when you choose.

For full step-by-step instructions, zero-cost WhatsApp setup, and troubleshooting, see **INSTALL.md**.

## ORCA governance (how this pod runs)

This pod runs with **ORCA** as **hidden middleware**: the agent creates/updates a traceability matrix and runs phase-locked steps internally; you see natural, conversational replies. Matrix, phases, and Trust Meter are not shown in every response — only when you ask (e.g. *"Show Trust Meter"* or *"Run ORCA audit"*). On deviation the agent responds in plain language (e.g. "Can't do that — risk too high") and notifies the founder. For the matrix schema and halt format, see shared **ORCA_MATRIX_AND_HALT_TEMPLATE.md** and **docs/ORCA_CORE_REFERENCE.md**.

## What You Have

- **Growth-Lead** persona folder — ready to drop into OpenClaw (you can rename to `[YourName]-Lead` if you prefer). Owns distribution, timing, engagement; **never creates content** (strict content/distribution boundary).
- **X-Growth-Skill** with autonomous posting protocol (X_POSTING_PROTOCOL.md).
- All **shared governance protocols** the Growth role needs (reversibility tiers, daily report format, veto protocol).
- **Pre-configured memory** and traceability starter.
- **ROI tracking template** and **example high-converting campaigns** in `Quickstart/`.
- **2 key diagrams** (Three-Component Merge, Growth Flywheel) in the `Diagrams/` folder.
- **Quickstart** founder rules and example short mandates.
- **Lifetime updates** to the Growth Engine configuration when you re-download from your account.

Everything is pre-built and governed. Install once and the Growth-Lead starts researching audiences, optimizing timing, posting, and feeding real results back — all while staying on-brand and driving measurable ROI.

## Founder Rule (non-negotiable)

**Short mandates only.** Message your Growth-Lead with 1–2 sentences. The pod runs growth; you get spot-check reports only when you decide. No daily novels.

See `Quickstart/FOUNDER_RULES.md` and `Quickstart/EXAMPLE_SHORT_MANDATES.md` for examples.
