# Founder Rules — Growth Engine

**Short mandates only.** This is the non-negotiable rule for how you work with your Growth-Lead.

---

## Why

- The pod runs growth and distribution autonomously. You are the brand steward and the veto; you are not the daily poster.
- Long messages train the system to wait for you instead of acting. Short mandates train it to own distribution and timing.
- Spot-check briefs only when **you** decide. The Growth-Lead does not dump engagement logs on you every day.

---

## What to do

- Send **1–2 sentences** when you want a schedule, a brief, or an optimization.
- Examples: *"Run your first audience research and posting schedule for our new offer."* *"Run HEARTBEAT and give me the growth brief."* *"Summarize reach, engagement, and conversions for the last 7 days."*
- When you want a report, ask for it in one line. When you want a campaign distributed, state the outcome in one line.

---

## What to avoid

- Do not send long paragraphs unless the Growth-Lead explicitly asks for one detail.
- Do not ask for daily narrative reports unless you want that as a one-off.
- Do not micromanage post-by-post; mandate the outcome and let the engine execute (and use the posting protocol).
