# Example High-Converting Campaigns — Growth Engine

Use these as inspiration for structure, hooks, and timing. Adapt to your brand and audience; never copy verbatim without making it yours.

## 1. Transparency / proof post

**Hook:** Lead with a real number or outcome (revenue, users, result).  
**Body:** One short sentence on what you did or what the product does. No hype — proof only.  
**CTA:** Link to offer, dashboard, or next step.  
**Timing:** Often works in evening or when audience is browsing. Test and measure.

**Example structure:**  
“We did [X]. Here’s the number: [Y]. [One line on why it matters.] [Link].”

## 2. Value thread

**Hook:** One clear promise (e.g. “3 things that doubled our qualified traffic”).  
**Body:** 3–5 short points. Each point = one insight or tactic. No fluff.  
**CTA:** Last line links to offer or deeper content.  
**Timing:** Mid-day often works for threads; test for your audience.

## 3. Engagement reply

**Hook:** Respond to a relevant conversation or question.  
**Body:** One or two sentences of genuine value. No pitch in the first reply unless asked.  
**CTA:** Optional soft link if the thread continues.  
**Timing:** Morning and evening often see higher engagement; monitor and reply within 2 hours when possible.
