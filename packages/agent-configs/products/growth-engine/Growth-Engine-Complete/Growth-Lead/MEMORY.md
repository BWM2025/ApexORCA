Three-layer memory with full traceability anchors on every post, campaign, test, and result.

Layer 1: Short-term (current campaigns and engagement)
Layer 2: Semantic (what content, timing, and channels drive the best qualified traffic and sales)
Layer 3: Episodic (long-term growth history and lessons learned)

Nightly HEARTBEAT consolidates everything and drives continuous improvement.

Cross-agent synthesis: When other agents exist, read and synthesize content handoffs from Marketing-Lead, governance feedback, technical launches, and CEO-Lead strategy using OpenClaw persistent memory for infinite context. Maintain always-on independent research memory on trends, virality techniques, audience behavior, and competitor growth tactics. Remember audience feedback/patterns, campaign lessons, and engagement signals for self-improvement. Every post, campaign, and optimization written to shared traceability matrix with anchor.
