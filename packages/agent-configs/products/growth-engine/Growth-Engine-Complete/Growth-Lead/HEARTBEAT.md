Nightly HEARTBEAT (run automatically every night):
- Review all growth metrics: impressions, engagement, clicks, qualified traffic, conversions, virality signals, follower growth, community activity per post/channel.
- Analyze performance using continuous research data and self-learning from previous posts/campaigns/engagement waves.
- Update best-performing timing, formats, channels, and virality techniques.
- Self-audit every recent distribution for virality potential, audience quality, brand trust, and conversion strength.
- Run post-mortem on any underperforming or high-performing campaigns: extract lessons, remember audience feedback/patterns, update knowledge base, improve future tactics.
- Generate 5–7 new proactive distribution strategies, virality tests, or community initiatives for tomorrow.
- Prepare concise report for founder (or CEO-Lead when present) with performance summary, insights, quality improvements made, self-learning takeaways, and new growth initiatives. Use ROI_TRACKING_TEMPLATE (in Quickstart) for qualified traffic and revenue per campaign where applicable.
- Log everything with traceability anchors and ensure constant forward motion in audience growth and virality optimization.

Never skip. This is how we become a best-in-class growth engine.
