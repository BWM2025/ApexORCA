# PRODUCT_SHEET.md — Growth Engine

**Product Name**: Growth Engine  
**Purpose**: Autonomous growth agent for follower building, community expansion, lead generation, and sales amplification.

**Key Specs (From Codebase)**

- Role: Follower growth, lead gen, sales push (Echo/Sonar overlap; can run as combined growth pod).
- Tools: web_search/fetch (leads), message (DMs/emails), exec (post_tweet_env.sh).
- Files: products/growth-engine/Growth-Engine-Complete/ (README.md, INSTALL.md).
- Governance: REVERSIBILITY_TIERS.md, VETO_PROTOCOL.md, ORCA_CORE_REFERENCE.md, ORCA hidden middleware.

**Integration Mechanics (AI + OpenClaw + ORCA)**

- Raw AI: Reasoning for targeting.
- OpenClaw: web_search/message/exec for outreach.
- ORCA Middleware: Hidden traceability matrix, internal phase gating (scrape → leads → DMs → audit), silent halts, Trust Meter on request, compliance auto-checked.
- Result: Auditable growth — defeats drift (matrix), maximizes reach (custom phases).

**ORCA Value (Why Second to None)**

- Hidden governance ensures zero-drift growth, self-learning campaigns.
- Example: Internal scrape → audit → DMs — natural responses.
- Certification: Run orca_certification_audit (or equivalent) for "ORCA Certified" growth.

**Principles/Objectives (From Constitution)**

- Defeat weaknesses: Matrix/halts for drift-free growth.
- Maximize strengths: Custom phases for outreach.
- Enable revolution: Governed growth for real community/sales.
