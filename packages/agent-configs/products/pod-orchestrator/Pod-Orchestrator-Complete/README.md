# Pod Orchestrator — The Central Nervous System for Your Agents

**The orchestration layer that turns your individual governed agents into one unified, self-sustaining company.**

You have powerful agents. Now give them the central nervous system they need to work together without chaos, duplicated effort, or constant human coordination.

**Pod Orchestrator** is the lightweight coordination layer that connects any number of your governed agents into one unified team — with shared memory, clean handoffs, leadership rhythms, and full traceability across the entire pod.

Raw AI gives each agent intelligence. OpenClaw gives each agent persistence and real action. Governance gives each agent structure and safety. **Pod Orchestrator adds the missing piece: coordination at scale** — so your agents feel like a real company instead of separate tools.

## Short Install User Guide (get running in minutes)

1. **Extract the ZIP** to any folder on your machine.
2. **Run the installer:** Open Terminal, `cd` into the extracted folder, then run:  
   `bash setup.sh`  
   (Or double-click `setup.sh` if your OS allows.)
3. **Restart OpenClaw** (or your agent gateway).  
   Example (macOS):  
   `launchctl kickstart -k gui/$(id -u)/ai.openclaw.gateway`
4. **In WhatsApp (or your chat interface),** message your **Pod-Orchestrator-Lead** with a **short mandate** to connect your existing agents.  
   Example: *"Run cross-agent HEARTBEAT and give me the pod brief"* or *"Sync all agents and report alignment status."*
5. **Done.** Your agents are now one coordinated, self-sustaining team. You only send short mandates; you get pod-level briefs when you choose.

For full step-by-step instructions, how to connect existing agents, zero-cost WhatsApp setup, and troubleshooting, see **INSTALL.md**.

## What You Have

- **Pod-Orchestrator-Lead** framework — ready to drop into your existing OpenClaw workspace (you can rename to `[YourName]-Lead` if you prefer).
- **Central Pod Charter template** (POD_CHARTER_TEMPLATE.md) + shared memory architecture.
- **Cross-agent HEARTBEAT protocol** and handoff templates.
- **Leadership & synchronization** approach (daily/weekly pod syncs).
- All **shared governance protocols** the orchestrator needs (reversibility tiers, daily report format, veto protocol).
- **2 key diagrams** (Three-Component Merge, Coordinated Pod Architecture) in the `Diagrams/` folder.
- **Quickstart** founder rules and example short mandates for managing the entire pod.
- **Lifetime updates** to the Pod Orchestrator coordination layer when you re-download from your account.

Install once and any agents or pods you already own instantly become part of one coordinated system.

## Founder Rule (non-negotiable)

**Short mandates only.** Message your Pod-Orchestrator-Lead with 1–2 sentences. The pod runs; you get spot-check pod briefs only when you decide. No daily novels.

See `Quickstart/FOUNDER_RULES.md` and `Quickstart/EXAMPLE_SHORT_MANDATES.md` for examples.
