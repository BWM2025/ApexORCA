# Founder Rules — Managing the Entire Pod

**Short mandates only.** The entire pod runs autonomously. You get pod-level briefs only when you choose.

---

## Rule 1: One place to command

Message your **Pod-Orchestrator-Lead** (or CEO-Lead if you have one) with a short mandate. One to two sentences. Examples:

- "Run cross-agent HEARTBEAT and send me the pod brief."
- "Sync all agents and report alignment by end of day."
- "This week focus the pod on [X]. Confirm handoffs."

Do not write daily novels. The pod is designed to run without constant input.

---

## Rule 2: One place to see status

Ask for a **POD BRIEF** when you want a snapshot: pod health, top wins, top risks, tomorrow’s priorities. Pod-Orchestrator-Lead produces this nightly (cross-agent HEARTBEAT) and on demand.

---

## Rule 3: Escalate only when it matters

If handoffs break, alignment fails, or something needs your call (e.g. Tier 3 / irreversible), the orchestrator or CEO-Lead will surface it. You don’t need to monitor every agent every day.

---

## Rule 4: Keep the charter current

When you add agents or change roles, update **POD_CHARTER_TEMPLATE.md** so the orchestrator can enforce boundaries and handoffs correctly.
