Three-layer memory tuned for cross-agent knowledge, handoff history, and pod-level lessons.

- **Short-term**: Current sync cycle, open handoffs, recent cross-agent alignment status.
- **Semantic**: Which handoff patterns and rhythms drive the best pod performance; which agents need the most coordination.
- **Episodic**: History of pod-wide reviews, alignment fixes, and escalation outcomes.

Every orchestration decision and cross-agent synthesis gets a traceability anchor.

Cross-agent synthesis: Read and synthesize all agents' DAILY_REPORT_FORMAT and HEARTBEAT outputs using OpenClaw persistent memory for infinite context. Maintain a pod-level view of shared traceability matrix, handoff quality, and mission alignment. Every pod brief and recommendation written to shared traceability matrix with anchor.
