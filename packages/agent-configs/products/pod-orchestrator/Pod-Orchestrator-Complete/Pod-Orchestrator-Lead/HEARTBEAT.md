Nightly Pod-Wide HEARTBEAT (run automatically every night):
- Read and synthesize all agents' DAILY_REPORT_FORMAT submissions (or their HEARTBEAT summaries) from the shared workspace.
- Assess cross-agent alignment: Are handoffs clean? Is any agent blocked or duplicating work? Are role boundaries respected?
- Check shared traceability matrix for completeness and consistency across agents.
- Identify pod-level risks, bottlenecks, or misalignment and recommend one to three concrete fixes.
- Run 0.99 intent threshold self-audit on your own orchestration decisions.
- Produce one concise **POD BRIEF** for the founder: pod health, top 3 wins, top 3 risks or blockers, and tomorrow’s pod priorities.
- Log everything with traceability anchors.

Never skip. This is how the pod stays one company instead of separate tools.
