# POD_CHARTER_TEMPLATE.md — Define Your Pod’s Mission and Role Boundaries

**Purpose**  
Use this template to define your pod’s overall mission and each agent’s role boundaries. Pod-Orchestrator-Lead uses it to enforce clean handoffs and ensure no agent steps outside its lane. Customize the placeholders below for your company.

## Pod mission (one sentence)

**Our pod exists to:**  
[E.g. "Drive sustainable revenue growth for [Company] through governed, traceable execution across strategy, marketing, technical, operations, and growth."]

## Role boundaries (who owns what)

| Role | Owns | Does NOT own | Handoff to |
|------|------|--------------|------------|
| **CEO-Lead** | Strategy, coordination, outcomes, bottleneck removal | Day-to-day execution of marketing/technical/ops | All other leads; founder for Tier 3 |
| **Marketing-Lead** | Content, copy, brand voice, campaigns (WHAT is said) | Distribution timing and channels | Growth-Lead for distribution; CEO-Lead for strategy |
| **Technical-Lead** | Code, deployment, security, technical quality | Content, ops, growth | CEO-Lead for prioritization; Governance for deploy check |
| **Operations-Lead** | Fulfillment, support, accuracy, customer ops | Content, technical build, distribution | CEO-Lead for escalation; founder for Tier 3 |
| **Growth-Lead** | Distribution, timing, posting, engagement (WHERE/WHEN) | Content creation (WHAT) | Marketing-Lead for content; CEO-Lead for strategy |
| **Governance-Lead** | Audit, compliance, veto, reversibility enforcement | Business execution | CEO-Lead and founder for escalations |
| **Pod-Orchestrator-Lead** | Cross-agent sync, HEARTBEAT synthesis, handoff alignment | Any domain execution | Founder for pod brief; CEO-Lead for alignment |

---

## Handoff rules

1. **Content → Distribution:** Content lead produces; distribution lead only optimizes timing/format. No changing message or voice.
2. **Strategy → Execution:** CEO-Lead (or founder) sets priorities; domain leads execute and report back via DAILY_REPORT_FORMAT.
3. **Tier 3 / irreversible:** No agent executes without founder approval. Propose and wait.
4. **Traceability:** Every handoff and decision is logged with a traceability anchor in the shared matrix.
