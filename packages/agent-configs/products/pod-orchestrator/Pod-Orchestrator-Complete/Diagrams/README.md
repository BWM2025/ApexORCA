# Diagrams

This folder is populated at build time with high-resolution PNGs:

- **figure-1-three-component-merge.png** — Real Agency = 3 Components (Raw AI + OpenClaw + Governance). Placed after the headline so buyers see how Pod Orchestrator completes the system.
- **figure-6-pod-architecture.png** — Coordinated AI Pod Architecture. Used in the "How Pod Orchestrator Works" section to show the connected team.

These files are copied from the playbook figures during the product ZIP build. No seller branding inside the images.
