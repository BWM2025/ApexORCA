# PRODUCT_SHEET.md — Pod Orchestrator

**Product Name**: Pod Orchestrator  
**Purpose**: Autonomous operating system for pod coordination, resource management, spawn/delegate, and efficiency across multiple agents.

**Key Specs (From Codebase)**

- Role: Pod orchestration, resource allocation, multi-agent coordination (Apex-led or dedicated orchestrator).
- Tools: sessions_spawn, memory_search/fetch, exec.
- Files: products/pod-orchestrator/Pod-Orchestrator-Complete/ (README.md, INSTALL.md).
- Governance: REVERSIBILITY_TIERS.md, VETO_PROTOCOL.md, ORCA_CORE_REFERENCE.md, shared traceability matrix.

**Integration Mechanics (AI + OpenClaw + ORCA)**

- Raw AI: Reasoning for allocation, delegation.
- OpenClaw: sessions_spawn/memory_search for coordination.
- ORCA Middleware: Hidden traceability matrix, internal phase gating (monitor → allocate → audit), silent halts, Trust Meter on request, compliance auto-checked.
- Result: Auditable ops — defeats drift (matrix), maximizes efficiency (custom phases).

**ORCA Value (Why Second to None)**

- Hidden governance ensures zero-drift coordination, self-learning resource use.
- Example: Internal monitor → audit → allocate — natural responses.
- Certification: Run orca_certification_audit (or equivalent) for "ORCA Certified" OS.

**Principles/Objectives (From Constitution)**

- Defeat weaknesses: Matrix/halts for drift-free ops.
- Maximize strengths: Custom phases for coordination.
- Enable revolution: Governed OS for real pod efficiency.
