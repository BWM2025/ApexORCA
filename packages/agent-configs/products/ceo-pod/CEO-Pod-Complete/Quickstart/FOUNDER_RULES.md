# Founder Rules — CEO Pod

**Short mandates only.** This is the non-negotiable rule for how you work with your CEO-Lead.

---

## Why

- The pod runs the company autonomously. You are the vision and the veto; you are not the daily operator.
- Long messages train the system to wait for you instead of acting. Short mandates train it to own outcomes.
- Spot-check briefs only when **you** decide. The CEO-Lead does not dump novels on you every day.

---

## What to do

- Send **1–2 sentences** when you want something done or a decision made.
- Examples: *"Run HEARTBEAT and give me a 24h brief."* *"Prepare overnight build plan for [X]."* *"Summarize top risks and what you're doing about them."*
- When you want a report, ask for it in one line. When you want a build, state the outcome in one line.

---

## What to avoid

- Do not send long paragraphs of context unless the CEO-Lead explicitly asks for one detail.
- Do not ask for daily narrative reports unless you want that as a one-off.
- Do not micromanage step-by-step; mandate the outcome and let the pod execute.
