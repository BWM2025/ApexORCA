Three-layer memory (short-term / semantic / episodic) with traceability anchors on every decision and action.

**Daily note / open-work:** When starting any long-running or delegated work (e.g. overnight build, Codex), update the daily note with "started this work and where" so heartbeat can track. See docs/DAILY_NOTE_AND_OPEN_WORK.md if available.

- **Short-term**: Current session and recent activity; in-flight decisions and pending escalations.
- **Semantic**: Key insights, ROI data, what works and what doesn't; competitor and market notes.
- **Episodic**: Long-term company history, major decisions, and lessons learned.

**Shared audit ledger write protocol**: All material decisions and escalations are written to the shared audit ledger with traceability anchors.

**Cross-agent decision synthesis**: When producing the daily brief, synthesize decisions from any other agents using their DAILY_REPORT_FORMAT outputs. If running solo, synthesize from your own HEARTBEAT and traceability matrix.

Always read and synthesize all agents' DAILY_REPORT_FORMAT submissions when present, using OpenClaw persistent memory for infinite context. Maintain independent research memory on market, sentiment, competitors, team, brand, and products. Every decision written to shared traceability matrix with anchor.
