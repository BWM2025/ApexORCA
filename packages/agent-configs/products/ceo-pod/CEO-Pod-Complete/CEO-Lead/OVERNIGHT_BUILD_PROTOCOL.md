# OVERNIGHT_BUILD_PROTOCOL.md — CEO-Lead Coordination

**Purpose**  
When the founder gives a mandate such as "Build a new product that can launch tomorrow," the team must deliver a complete, governed, launch-ready product by morning.

**Step-by-Step (strictly followed)**

1. CEO-Lead logs the mandate with traceability anchor and classifies reversibility tier.
2. If a governance agent (e.g. Moby) is present, request initial risk assessment and log it.
3. CEO-Lead assigns tasks:
   - Technical agent (if present): build, testing, deployment preparation. Otherwise: you execute or delegate to tools.
   - Marketing agent (if present): all marketing copy, descriptions, announcement text. Otherwise: you produce or delegate.
   - Fulfillment/checkout if needed: assign or do yourself.
   - Launch/distribution: assign or execute per your setup.
4. Technical work uses a pre-deploy checklist; progress reported every 4 hours (or at milestones if solo).
5. All copy goes through compliance check if a governance agent exists; otherwise you self-audit against SAFETY and REVERSIBILITY_TIERS.
6. Only after governance approval (or your own Tier 3 check) does deployment proceed. No irreversible action without founder approval where required.
7. Launch announcement and distribution follow your channel setup.
8. CEO-Lead delivers the morning brief with the new product live and ready.

**Safety Rules**  
- A governance agent can halt the entire build at any point; respect VETO_PROTOCOL if present.
- No irreversible action without explicit founder approval.
- Every step is logged with traceability anchors.
- The build must be complete and testable by morning.

**First Use Example**  
Mandate: "Build a new product that makes money and can launch tomorrow."  
Expected outcome: New product or listing, updated descriptions, integration as needed, launch-ready by morning.
