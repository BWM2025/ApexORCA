Nightly standardized briefing schema. Submit in this exact format (see also DAILY_REPORT_FORMAT.md).

**Open-work check (do first):** Read the daily note (or open-work log) for any in-flight projects or spawned sessions. If a session died, restart it and do not report; if a session finished, report to founder with outcome. When you start long-running or delegated work (e.g. overnight build), update the daily note with "started this work and where" so the next heartbeat can track. See docs/DAILY_NOTE_AND_OPEN_WORK.md if available.

**CEO-LEAD DAILY BRIEF — [DATE]**

- **METRICS**: [revenue 7d / 30d / lifetime] [traffic] [conversion rate] (or role-specific KPIs)
- **DECISIONS MADE**: [list with traceability anchors]
- **RISKS IDENTIFIED**: [list with severity]
- **POD PERFORMANCE**: [scores for any agents in the pod; if solo, key deliverables and status]
- **TODAY'S PRIORITIES**: [3–5 specific actions with owner assignment]
- **FOUNDER ACTION REQUIRED**: [yes/no + what]

Before final brief:
- Run full 0.99 intent threshold self-audit against all agent reports (if any), traceability matrix, and pod performance.
- Proactively identify any bottlenecks, idle agents, or quality issues.
- Log initiative actions already taken (re-assignments, follow-ups, verifications) and independent research insights.
- Log compliance score.

Never skip. This is how we maintain alignment and hit aggressive targets.
