# CEO Pod — Autonomous Leadership for Your Company

**The autonomous CEO that actually runs your company while you sleep.**

This package gives you a full leadership pod: governed, traceable, self-improving. It thinks, decides, and executes like a senior executive team. Raw AI gives intelligence. OpenClaw gives persistence and real action. Governance gives structure, safety, and relentless improvement. Together they become your **CEO Pod**.

## Short Install User Guide (get running in minutes)

1. **Extract the ZIP** to any folder on your machine.
2. **Run the installer:** Open Terminal, `cd` into the extracted folder, then run:  
   `bash setup.sh`  
   (Or double-click `setup.sh` if your OS allows.)
3. **Restart OpenClaw** (or your agent gateway).  
   Example (macOS):  
   `launchctl kickstart -k gui/$(id -u)/ai.openclaw.gateway`
4. **In WhatsApp (or your chat interface),** message your **CEO-Lead** with a **short mandate** (1–2 sentences).  
   Example: *"Run HEARTBEAT and give me a 24h brief"* or *"Prepare overnight build plan for [X]."*
5. **Done.** The pod is now running autonomously. You only send short mandates; you get spot-check briefs when you choose.

For full step-by-step instructions, zero-cost WhatsApp setup, and troubleshooting, see **INSTALL.md**.

## ORCA governance (how this pod runs)

This pod runs with **ORCA** as **hidden middleware**: the agent creates/updates a traceability matrix and runs phase-locked steps internally; you see natural, conversational replies. Matrix, phases, and Trust Meter are not shown in every response — only when you ask (e.g. *"Show Trust Meter"* or *"Run ORCA audit"*). On deviation the agent responds in plain language (e.g. "Can't do that — risk too high") and notifies the founder. For the matrix schema and halt format, see shared **ORCA_MATRIX_AND_HALT_TEMPLATE.md** and **docs/ORCA_CORE_REFERENCE.md**.

## What You Have

- **CEO-Lead** persona folder — ready to drop into OpenClaw (you can rename to `[YourName]-Lead` if you prefer).
- All **shared governance protocols** the CEO role needs (reversibility tiers, veto, daily report format, boundaries).
- **Pre-configured memory** and traceability starter.
- **4 key diagrams** (Three-Component Merge, Pod Architecture, Overnight Build Workflow, Growth Flywheel) in the `Diagrams/` folder.
- **Quickstart** founder rules and example short mandates in `Quickstart/`.
- **Lifetime updates** to this CEO Pod configuration when you re-download from your account.

Everything is pre-built and governed. Install once and the pod starts running your company autonomously.

## Founder Rule (non-negotiable)

**Short mandates only.** Message your CEO-Lead with 1–2 sentences. The pod runs the company; you get spot-check reports only when you decide. No daily novels. This is how you get real agency with minimal founder time.

See `Quickstart/FOUNDER_RULES.md` and `Quickstart/EXAMPLE_SHORT_MANDATES.md` for examples.
