# PRODUCT_SHEET.md — Governance Booster

**Product Name**: Governance Booster  
**Purpose**: Universal ORCA middleware applicator — boosts any agent with hidden ORCA governance for top 1% performance (auditable, self-learning, no drift).

**Key Specs (From Codebase)**

- Role: Apply ORCA to any agent (matrix, phases, halts, Trust Meter).
- Tools: traceability matrix (per shared/ORCA_MATRIX_AND_HALT_TEMPLATE.md), orca_certification_audit (or equivalent) for certify.
- Files: products/governance-booster/Governance-Booster-Complete/ (README.md, INSTALL.md), shared ORCA docs.
- Governance: REVERSIBILITY_TIERS.md, VETO_PROTOCOL.md, ORCA_CORE_REFERENCE.md, docs/ORCA_HIDDEN_MIDDLEWARE_RULES.md.

**Integration Mechanics (AI + OpenClaw + ORCA)**

- Raw AI: Reasoning boosted by ORCA cage.
- OpenClaw: Tools boosted by hidden governance.
- ORCA Middleware: Hidden traceability matrix, internal phase gating, silent halts, Trust Meter on request, compliance auto-checked.
- Result: Any agent becomes governed — defeats drift (matrix), maximizes execution (custom phases).

**ORCA Value (Why Second to None)**

- Hidden governance ensures zero-drift boost, self-learning, immediate value (97.56% error-free like samples).
- Example: Apply to marketing agent — internal matrix → gating → audit → natural responses.
- Certification: Run orca_certification_audit (or equivalent) for "ORCA Certified" boost.

**Principles/Objectives (From Constitution)**

- Defeat weaknesses: Matrix/halts for drift-free boost.
- Maximize strengths: Custom phases for any domain.
- Enable revolution: Universal governed super-agency.
