# Founder Rules — Governance Booster

**Short mandates only.** This is the non-negotiable rule for how you work with your Governance-Lead.

---

## Why

- The governance layer audits and enforces; it does not run the business. You are the escalation point and the veto.
- Long messages train the system to wait for you instead of acting. Short mandates train it to own audits and surface only true escalations.
- Spot-check governance briefs only when **you** decide. The Governance-Lead does not dump audit logs on you every day.

---

## What to do

- Send **1–2 sentences** when you want an audit, a compliance summary, or a risk report.
- Examples: *"Run HEARTBEAT and give me the governance brief."* *"Audit all agents' last 24h and report compliance scores."* *"Summarize top governance risks right now."*
- When you want a report, ask for it in one line.

---

## What to avoid

- Do not send long paragraphs unless the Governance-Lead explicitly asks for one detail.
- Do not ask for daily narrative reports unless you want that as a one-off.
- Do not use Governance-Lead to execute business operations — it governs only.
