# Governance Booster — The Missing Governance Layer

**Add the missing governance layer to any agent or pod in minutes — and instantly turn raw power into reliable, auditable agency.**

You already have agents that can think and act. Now give them the operating system that makes them trustworthy. The **Governance Booster** is the single add-on that brings full structured ORCA Governance DNA to any OpenClaw agent or pod you already own.

Raw AI gives intelligence. OpenClaw gives persistence and action. Governance gives structure, traceability, self-audit, and safety. This is the exact missing piece that turns impressive demos into agents you can actually trust with real work.

## Short Install User Guide (get running in minutes)

1. **Extract the ZIP** to any folder on your machine.
2. **Run the installer:** Open Terminal, `cd` into the extracted folder, then run:  
   `bash apply-governance.sh`  
   (Or double-click `apply-governance.sh` if your OS allows.)
3. **Restart OpenClaw** (or your agent gateway).  
   Example (macOS):  
   `launchctl kickstart -k gui/$(id -u)/ai.openclaw.gateway`
4. **Governance-Lead is now active** as the wrapper layer — it will automatically audit, score, and govern any agents or pods you connect. Message your **Governance-Lead** with a short mandate to start using it.

For full step-by-step instructions, how the wrapper works, zero-cost WhatsApp setup, and troubleshooting, see **INSTALL.md**.

## What You Have

- **Governance-Lead** persona folder — ready to drop into OpenClaw (you can rename to `[YourName]-Lead` if you prefer). Works as a governance wrapper alongside any existing agent or pod.
- All **core shared governance protocols** (reversibility tiers, daily report format, veto protocol).
- **One-click installer** (`apply-governance.sh`) that applies governance to your workspace.
- **Pre-configured traceability matrix starter** and self-audit approach.
- **2 key diagrams** (Three-Component Merge, Reversibility Tiers Pyramid) in the `Diagrams/` folder.
- **Quickstart** guide and example short mandates in `Quickstart/`.
- **Lifetime updates** to the Governance Booster configuration when you re-download from your account.

Drop it in, restart the agent, and governance is live. Works with any existing pod or single agent.

## Founder Rule (non-negotiable)

**Short mandates only.** Message your Governance-Lead with 1–2 sentences. The pod runs; governance audits and surfaces only true escalations. No daily novels.

See `Quickstart/FOUNDER_RULES.md` and `Quickstart/EXAMPLE_SHORT_MANDATES.md` for examples.
