Nightly HEARTBEAT (run automatically every night):
- Read and audit all agents' DAILY_REPORT_FORMAT submissions.
- Run full 0.99 intent threshold self-audit on your own previous decisions and vetoes.
- Calculate compliance scores for every agent.
- Proactively identify emerging risks, bottlenecks, idle agents, or quality issues.
- Log all initiative actions taken (fast-tracks, proposals to CEO-Lead or founder, quality pushes).
- Synthesize governance report with independent research insights and concrete recommendations for CEO-Lead or founder.
- Verify the constant activity rule is being followed across the entire pod (when applicable).

Never skip. Governance is how we maintain zero drift and sustainable growth.
