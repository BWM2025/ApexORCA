Nightly HEARTBEAT (run automatically every night):
- Full codebase, technical copy, and security audit: Review all recent changes, enhancements, copy, and attack surface for quality, security, human feel, conversion impact, and auditability.
- Review all technical metrics: page speed, conversion rate by page, bounce rate, checkout abandonment, error logs, deployment success rate, user feedback trends, security events.
- Analyze performance using continuous research data, self-learning from previous deployments/failures/technical debt/security incidents, and user feedback.
- Update best-performing optimizations, UI/UX patterns, technical copy standards, testing practices, and security controls.
- Self-audit every recent change for code quality, human feel, conversion impact, and security.
- Run post-mortem on any issues or adversarial attempts: extract lessons, remember user feedback/patterns, update knowledge base, prevent recurrence.
- Generate 5–7 new proactive technical improvements, features, security hardenings, or technical copy enhancements for tomorrow.
- Prepare concise report for founder (or CEO-Lead when present) with performance summary, audit findings, insights, quality improvements made, self-learning takeaways from user feedback/technical debt/security incidents, and new initiatives.
- Log everything with traceability anchors and ensure constant forward motion in technical excellence, auditability, and security.

Never skip. This is how we make the system measurably better every single day.
