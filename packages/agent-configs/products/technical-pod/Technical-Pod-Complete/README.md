# Technical Pod — Your Autonomous CTO That Builds and Ships

**Your autonomous CTO that builds, optimizes, and ships while you focus on the big picture.**

Stop spending nights debugging, testing, and tweaking features yourself. Stop watching raw AI agents break things or ship half-finished work. You now have a full **Technical Pod** — governed, traceable, and obsessively focused on building fast, shipping reliably, and continuously improving your product.

Raw AI gives intelligence and code generation. OpenClaw gives persistent memory, real tool execution, and deployment capability. Governance gives phase-locking, self-audit, reversibility tiers, and zero-drift reliability. Together they become your dedicated Technical Pod.

## Short Install User Guide (get running in minutes)

1. **Extract the ZIP** to any folder on your machine.
2. **Run the installer:** Open Terminal, `cd` into the extracted folder, then run:  
   `bash setup.sh`  
   (Or double-click `setup.sh` if your OS allows.)
3. **Restart OpenClaw** (or your agent gateway).  
   Example (macOS):  
   `launchctl kickstart -k gui/$(id -u)/ai.openclaw.gateway`
4. **In WhatsApp (or your chat interface),** message your **Technical-Lead** with a **short mandate** (1–2 sentences).  
   Example: *"Run HEARTBEAT and give me the technical brief"* or *"Implement [feature] and run the pre-deploy checklist."*
5. **Done.** The Technical Pod is now running autonomously. You only send short mandates; you get spot-check briefs when you choose.

For full step-by-step instructions, zero-cost WhatsApp setup, and troubleshooting, see **INSTALL.md**.

## ORCA governance (how this pod runs)

This pod runs with **ORCA** as **hidden middleware**: the agent creates/updates a traceability matrix and runs phase-locked steps internally; you see natural, conversational replies. Matrix, phases, and Trust Meter are not shown in every response — only when you ask (e.g. *"Show Trust Meter"* or *"Run ORCA audit"*). On deviation the agent responds in plain language (e.g. "Can't do that — risk too high") and notifies the founder. For the matrix schema and halt format, see shared **ORCA_MATRIX_AND_HALT_TEMPLATE.md** and **docs/ORCA_CORE_REFERENCE.md**.

## What You Have

- **Technical-Lead** persona folder — ready to drop into OpenClaw (you can rename to `[YourName]-Lead` if you prefer).
- All **shared governance protocols** the Technical role needs (reversibility tiers, daily report format, veto protocol).
- **Pre-deploy checklist** (PRE_DEPLOY_CHECKLIST.md) enforced before any deployment.
- **Pre-configured memory** and traceability starter.
- **4 key diagrams** (Three-Component Merge, Three-Layer Memory Stack, Reversibility Tiers, Overnight Build Workflow) in the `Diagrams/` folder.
- **Quickstart** founder rules and example short mandates in `Quickstart/`.
- **Lifetime updates** to this Technical Pod configuration when you re-download from your account.

Everything is pre-built and governed. Install once and the pod starts handling development, optimization, testing, and deployment autonomously while staying fully aligned with your brand.

## Founder Rule (non-negotiable)

**Short mandates only.** Message your Technical-Lead with 1–2 sentences. The pod runs technical work; you get spot-check reports only when you decide. No daily novels. This is how you get real technical agency with minimal founder time.

See `Quickstart/FOUNDER_RULES.md` and `Quickstart/EXAMPLE_SHORT_MANDATES.md` for examples.
