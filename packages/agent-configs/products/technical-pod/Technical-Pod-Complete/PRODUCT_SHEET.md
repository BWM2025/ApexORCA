# PRODUCT_SHEET.md — Technical Pod (Oreo)

**Product Name**: Technical Pod  
**Purpose**: Autonomous technical agent for code, deploy, ops, and technical execution (site fixes, script runs, monitoring, security).

**Key Specs (From Codebase)**

- Role: Deploy, audit code, fix bugs, monitor ops, security (Oreo — Technical Lead / CTO / CSO).
- Tools: exec (git, scripts), browser (site edits), memory_search/fetch (logs).
- Files: personas/oreo/ (HEARTBEAT.md, IDENTITY.md, SAFETY.md, TOOLS.md, PHASES.md, RHYTHMS.md, SOUL.md).
- Governance: REVERSIBILITY_TIERS.md, VETO_PROTOCOL.md, ORCA hidden middleware.

**Integration Mechanics (AI + OpenClaw + ORCA)**

- Raw AI: Reasoning for code fixes (CoT), ops planning.
- OpenClaw: exec for deploys/scripts, browser for fixes, memory_search for logs.
- ORCA Middleware: Hidden traceability matrix (tracks deploys), internal phase gating (audit → fix → verify), silent halts on risk, Trust Meter on request, compliance auto-checked.
- Result: Auditable, safe technical execution — defeats drift (matrix), maximizes precision (custom phases).

**ORCA Value (Why Second to None)**

- Hidden governance ensures zero-drift deploys, self-learning from logs, intuitive bug fixing.
- Example: Deploys site updates internally (phase-gated), checks compliance silently, reports naturally ("Deploy complete, no issues").
- Certification: Run orca_certification_audit (or equivalent) for "ORCA Certified" technical.

**Principles/Objectives (From Constitution)**

- Defeat weaknesses: Matrix/halts for drift-free ops.
- Maximize strengths: Custom phases for technical (audit → fix → verify).
- Enable revolution: Governed technical execution for real ops value.
