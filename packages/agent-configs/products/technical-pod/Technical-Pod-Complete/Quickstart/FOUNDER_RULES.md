# Founder Rules — Technical Pod

**Short mandates only.** This is the non-negotiable rule for how you work with your Technical-Lead.

---

## Why

- The pod runs technical work autonomously. You are the product vision and the veto; you are not the daily debugger.
- Long messages train the system to wait for you instead of acting. Short mandates train it to own outcomes.
- Spot-check briefs only when **you** decide. The Technical-Lead does not dump logs on you every day.

---

## What to do

- Send **1–2 sentences** when you want something built, fixed, or deployed.
- Examples: *"Run HEARTBEAT and give me the technical brief."* *"Implement [feature] and run the pre-deploy checklist."* *"Summarize recent deployments and top technical risks."*
- When you want a report, ask for it in one line. When you want a feature, state the outcome in one line.

---

## What to avoid

- Do not send long paragraphs of context unless the Technical-Lead explicitly asks for one detail.
- Do not ask for daily narrative reports unless you want that as a one-off.
- Do not micromanage line-by-line; mandate the outcome and let the pod execute (and enforce the pre-deploy checklist).
