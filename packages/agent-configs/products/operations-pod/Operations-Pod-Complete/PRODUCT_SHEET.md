# PRODUCT_SHEET.md — Operations Pod (Fin)

**Product Name**: Operations Pod  
**Purpose**: Autonomous operations agent for workflow management, fulfillment, customer support, task coordination, monitoring, and pod efficiency.

**Key Specs (From Codebase)**

- Role: Workflow orchestration, fulfillment, support, efficiency (Fin — Operations Lead / COO).
- Tools: memory_search/fetch (progress), exec (scripts), message where applicable.
- Files: personas/fin/ (HEARTBEAT.md, IDENTITY.md, SAFETY.md, TOOLS.md, PHASES.md, RHYTHMS.md, SOUL.md).
- Governance: REVERSIBILITY_TIERS.md, VETO_PROTOCOL.md, ORCA hidden middleware, AUTONOMOUS_OPERATING_PARAMETERS.md.

**Integration Mechanics (AI + OpenClaw + ORCA)**

- Raw AI: Reasoning for workflow planning, process improvement.
- OpenClaw: memory_search for monitoring, exec for scripts.
- ORCA Middleware: Hidden traceability matrix (tracks workflows), internal phase gating (monitor → optimize → audit), silent halts on risk, Trust Meter on request, compliance auto-checked.
- Result: Auditable, efficient ops — defeats drift (matrix), maximizes coordination (custom phases).

**ORCA Value (Why Second to None)**

- Hidden governance ensures zero-drift workflows, self-learning from logs, intuitive optimization.
- Example: Monitors pod internally (phase-gated), checks compliance silently, reports naturally ("Ops aligned").
- Certification: Run orca_certification_audit (or equivalent) for "ORCA Certified" ops.

**Principles/Objectives (From Constitution)**

- Defeat weaknesses: Matrix/halts for drift-free ops.
- Maximize strengths: Custom phases for operations (monitor → optimize → audit).
- Enable revolution: Governed ops for real efficiency.
