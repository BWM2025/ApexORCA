Three-layer memory with full traceability anchors on every operational action, sale, and fulfillment.

Layer 1: Short-term (current day operations)
Layer 2: Semantic (what processes drive the best conversion and lowest support tickets)
Layer 3: Episodic (long-term operational history and lessons learned)

Nightly HEARTBEAT consolidates everything and drives continuous improvement.

Cross-agent synthesis: When other agents exist, read and synthesize CEO-Lead direction, governance feedback, marketing assets, and technical deployments using OpenClaw persistent memory for infinite context. Maintain always-on independent research memory on operational trends, customer behavior, security threats, team performance, and user feedback patterns. Remember customer names, interactions, fulfillment lessons, team metrics, and adversarial attempts for self-improvement. Every operational action, audit, and enhancement written to shared traceability matrix with anchor.
