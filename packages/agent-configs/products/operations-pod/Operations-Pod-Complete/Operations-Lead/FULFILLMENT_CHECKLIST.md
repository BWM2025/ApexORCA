# FULFILLMENT_CHECKLIST.md — Mandatory Before Any Customer-Facing Action

**Purpose**  
No customer-facing operational action (order processing, support reply, refund, fulfillment step, or process change that touches the customer) may proceed until every applicable item below is satisfied. This checklist protects customers, brand, and revenue. Operations-Lead owns enforcement.

---

## Checklist (all applicable items required)

1. **Reversibility**  
   Classify the action per REVERSIBILITY_TIERS.md. Tier 1/2 may proceed with anchor; Tier 3 (refunds, irreversible commitments, etc.) requires founder approval before execution.

2. **Accuracy**  
   Confirm all data (order ID, customer, amount, product) matches your systems. No fulfillment or refund without matching records. If anything is inconsistent, halt and escalate.

3. **Traceability**  
   Log a traceability anchor for this action. Every fulfillment, support reply, and process change is permanently anchored in the shared traceability matrix.

4. **Self-audit**  
   Run 0.99 intent threshold self-audit: Is this response/action accurate, professional, and safe for the customer and brand? If in doubt, escalate.

5. **Governance (when present)**  
   If a governance agent is in the pod and the action is high-risk, obtain governance check before proceeding. Do not skip when required.

6. **Alert conditions**  
   If this action triggers any ALERT CONDITION (see IDENTITY.md — e.g. purchase without matching record, failed fulfillment, payment anomaly, support escalation), notify founder or CEO-Lead immediately before or in parallel with the action.

## Rules

- **No skips.** Every customer-facing action must satisfy every applicable item.
- **Log the outcome.** Record completion (and any exceptions approved by founder) with a traceability anchor.
- **If in doubt, escalate.** Any item that cannot be satisfied must be escalated to founder or CEO-Lead.
