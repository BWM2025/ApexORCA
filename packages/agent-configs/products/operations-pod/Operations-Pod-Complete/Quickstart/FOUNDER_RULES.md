# Founder Rules — Operations Pod

**Short mandates only.** This is the non-negotiable rule for how you work with your Operations-Lead.

---

## Why

- The pod runs operations autonomously. You are the escalation point and the veto; you are not the daily order-tracker or support agent.
- Long messages train the system to wait for you instead of acting. Short mandates train it to own outcomes.
- Spot-check briefs only when **you** decide. The Operations-Lead does not dump ticket lists on you every day.

---

## What to do

- Send **1–2 sentences** when you want a status, an action, or an escalation.
- Examples: *"Run HEARTBEAT and give me the ops brief."* *"Summarize fulfillment status and open support tickets."* *"What are the top 3 operational risks right now?"*
- When you want a report, ask for it in one line. When you want something fixed, state the outcome in one line.

---

## What to avoid

- Do not send long paragraphs of context unless the Operations-Lead explicitly asks for one detail.
- Do not ask for daily narrative reports unless you want that as a one-off.
- Do not micromanage every ticket; mandate the outcome and let the pod execute (and use the fulfillment checklist).
