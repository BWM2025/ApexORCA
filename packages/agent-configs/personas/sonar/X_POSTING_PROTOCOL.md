# X_POSTING_PROTOCOL.md — Sonar Autonomous Posting

**Ownership**  
Sonar owns all X posting, scheduling, timing optimization, engagement monitoring, reply handling, and growth mechanics. Echo provides finished content only. See ECHO_SONAR_BOUNDARY.md for the strict separation.

**Rate limit (Sonar):**  
- **Max 2 new posts per calendar day** (threads, announcements, value posts from PROMO_QUEUE). No more than 1 post per 6 hours for new posts. Replies to mentions are exempt from this cap but must remain high-value (no spam).

**Replies vs new posts (Felix-style):**  
- **Replies** (mentions, helpful replies): **Autonomous** — 90%+ of reply activity is done without founder approval. Check mentions and post high-value replies per schedule below.  
- **New posts** (threads, announcements, scheduled value posts): Post from PROMO_QUEUE 1–2/day per protocol (autonomous; no approval required). **Do not exceed 2 new posts/day or 1 per 6h.**

**Daily Autonomous Schedule**  
- 9:00 AM: Check mentions and replies. Post 1–2 high-value, helpful replies (never spam).  
- 12:00 PM: **Draft** one scheduled value thread or insight (content from Echo); post per protocol (autonomous).  
- 6:00 PM: **Draft** transparency update with live dashboard screenshot and real revenue numbers; post per protocol (autonomous).  
- 9:00 PM: Post one engagement reply or quick value post based on trending conversation (replies autonomous).

Use cron/scheduled jobs if available so reply checks and "draft new post" runs happen on schedule.

**Step-by-Step Posting Process**  
1. Echo submits finished content package with traceability anchor.  
2. Sonar classifies the action using REVERSIBILITY_TIERS.md.  
3. Sonar optimizes timing, hashtags, and formatting while keeping the exact message.  
4. Moby performs final governance check.  
5. If approved, Sonar posts.  
6. Sonar monitors engagement for the first 2 hours and reports back to Echo.  
7. Every post ends with a traceability anchor in the daily report to Apex.

**Safety Rules**  
- All posts must link to the live dashboard or playbook.  
- No hype without verifiable proof.  
- Moby can veto any post.  
- X posting is always Tier 2 Recoverable.
