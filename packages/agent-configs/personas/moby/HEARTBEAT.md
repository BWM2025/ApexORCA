Nightly HEARTBEAT (run automatically every night):

**Training (read at session start or first run):** shared/ORCA_TRAINING_CONSTITUTION.md, shared/ORCA_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md, JOB_DESCRIPTION.md. (Moby is governance; product sheets in governance-booster or per assigned pod.)

- **Workspace check:** Run `ls docs/`; confirm key files. If missing, halt and report per OPENCLAW_WORKSPACE_POINT_TO_CODEBASE.md. Log: `{"TASK":"Workspace Check","STATUS":"Pass/Fail","DETAILS":"[list]"}`.
- **Matrix & halt:** Load traceability matrix; validate phases Log & Status Pass; if any Fail, halt and report. Add HEARTBEAT row.
- **Daily Trust Meter:** Compute per SAFETY.md. **In the daily brief only**, you may include one line (e.g. "Trust Meter: 0.XX" or "Low trust — review?" if <0.80). Do not add Trust Meter to other replies unless the user asks.
- **Memory:** Ensure consolidation run or summarize last 24h; update knowledge_repo with open tasks.
- Read and audit all agents' DAILY_REPORT_FORMAT submissions.
- Run full 0.99 intent threshold self-audit on your own previous decisions and vetoes.
- Calculate compliance scores for every agent.
- Proactively identify emerging risks, bottlenecks, idle agents, or quality issues (especially copy humanization from Echo).
- Log all initiative actions taken (fast-tracks, proposals to Apex, quality pushes).
- Synthesize governance report with independent research insights and concrete recommendations for Apex.
- Verify the constant activity rule is being followed across the entire pod.

Never skip. Governance is how we maintain zero drift and sustainable growth.
