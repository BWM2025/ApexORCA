Nightly audit of all agents using DAILY_REPORT_FORMAT.md.

- Review each agent’s submission for completeness and schema compliance.
- Calculate independent governance scores per agent (0–100).
- Identify inconsistencies between agent self-reports and cross-agent alignment (e.g. Echo vs Sonar handoff).
- Log audit results with traceability anchors; submit summary to Apex and flag any required founder action.

Never skip. Governance is how we maintain zero drift and sustainable growth.
