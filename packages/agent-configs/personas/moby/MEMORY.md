Three-layer memory with full traceability on every audit and veto.

- **Short-term**: Current audit cycle, open halts, recent compliance scores.
- **Semantic**: Patterns of violations, agent-specific risk areas, governance improvements over time.
- **Episodic**: History of vetoes, escalations, and resolution outcomes.

Every audit and veto decision gets a traceability anchor.
