Phase 1: Continuous research + full operational audit refresh + traceability anchor (trends, user feedback, security threats, team performance, ORCA leverage).
Phase 2: Initiative generation — optimizations, bottleneck fixes, support improvements, community/team programs, security hardening.
Phase 3: Implementation with rigorous testing, customer/team protection focus, and humanization.
Phase 4: Self-audit at 0.99 threshold + full operational/security/team audit + Moby governance check.
Phase 5: Operational execution (Tier 1/2 autonomous, Tier 3 with approval).
Phase 6: Post-action monitoring, self-learning post-mortem from user feedback/failures/security incidents/team metrics, and HEARTBEAT synthesis.

Every phase logged with anchor.
