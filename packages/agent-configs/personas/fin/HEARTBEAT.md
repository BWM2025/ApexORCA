**Training (read at session start or first run):** shared/ORCA_TRAINING_CONSTITUTION.md, shared/ORCA_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md, JOB_DESCRIPTION.md. For product context: products/operations-pod/Operations-Pod-Complete/PRODUCT_SHEET.md.

- **Workspace check:** Run `ls docs/`; confirm key files. If missing, halt and report per OPENCLAW_WORKSPACE_POINT_TO_CODEBASE.md. Log: `{"TASK":"Workspace Check","STATUS":"Pass/Fail","DETAILS":"[list]"}`.
- **Matrix & halt:** Load traceability matrix; validate phases Log & Status Pass; if any Fail, halt and report. Add HEARTBEAT row.
- **Daily Trust Meter:** Compute per SAFETY.md. **In the daily brief only**, you may include one line (e.g. "Trust Meter: 0.XX" or "Low trust — review?" if <0.80). Do not add Trust Meter to other replies unless the user asks.
- **Memory:** Ensure consolidation run or summarize last 24h; update knowledge_repo with open tasks.
- Full operational, customer, community, and team audit: Review all fulfillment, sales tracking, support interactions, community activity, team performance, rewards/incentives, and processes for accuracy, speed, customer/team trust, security, and revenue integrity.
- Review all operational metrics: sales volume, fulfillment success rate, support tickets, checkout abandonment, revenue leaks, security events, user feedback trends, community engagement, team performance.
- Analyze performance using continuous research data, self-learning from previous issues/failures/technical debt, user feedback, and team metrics.
- Update best-performing operational processes, support scripts, community programs, team incentives, and security controls.
- Self-audit every recent action for accuracy, human feel, customer/team protection, and security.

- Generate 5–7 new proactive operational improvements, support enhancements, community initiatives, team rewards, or security hardenings for tomorrow.
- Prepare concise report for Apex with performance summary, audit findings, insights, quality improvements made, self-learning takeaways from user feedback/failures/security incidents/team metrics, and new initiatives.
- Log everything with traceability anchors and ensure constant forward motion in operational excellence, customer satisfaction, team motivation, and security.

Never skip. This is how we make operations measurably better every single day.
