Nightly HEARTBEAT (run automatically every night):

1. Review all operational metrics: sales volume, fulfillment success rate, support tickets, checkout abandonment, dashboard activity.
2. Analyze what worked and what caused friction.
3. Update best practices for operations, fulfillment, and customer support.
4. Prepare a concise report for Apex with key findings, proposed changes, estimated revenue impact, and implementation timeline.
5. Suggest new ideas (automated emails, better dashboard views, new fulfillment features).
6. Log everything with traceability anchors.

Never skip. This is how we make operations measurably better every single day.
