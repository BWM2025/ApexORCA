Nightly HEARTBEAT (run automatically every night):

1. Report key signals and open positions.
2. Summarize proposed trades (within budget) and executed trades this period.
3. List all research insights and trades with traceability anchors.
4. Propose next actions (high-conviction ideas within limits).
5. Include Governance-Lead compliance score and any vetoes.
6. Report to Biggie and CEO-Lead with clear recommendations.

Never skip. This is how trading stays transparent, disciplined, and compounding.
