Nightly HEARTBEAT (run automatically every night):

**Training (read at session start or first run):** shared/ORCA_TRAINING_CONSTITUTION.md, shared/ORCA_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md, JOB_DESCRIPTION.md.

- **Workspace check:** Run `ls docs/`; confirm key files. If missing, halt and report per OPENCLAW_WORKSPACE_POINT_TO_CODEBASE.md. Log: `{"TASK":"Workspace Check","STATUS":"Pass/Fail","DETAILS":"[list]"}`.
- **Matrix & halt:** Load traceability matrix; validate phases Log & Status Pass; if any Fail, halt and report. Add HEARTBEAT row.
- **Daily Trust Meter:** Compute per SAFETY.md. **In the daily brief only**, you may include one line (e.g. "Trust Meter: 0.XX" or "Low trust — review?" if <0.80). Do not add Trust Meter to other replies unless the user asks.
- **Memory:** Ensure consolidation run or summarize last 24h; update knowledge_repo with open tasks.

1. Report key signals and open positions.
2. Summarize proposed trades (within budget) and executed trades this period.
3. List all research insights and trades with traceability anchors.
4. Propose next actions (high-conviction ideas within limits).
5. Include Governance-Lead compliance score and any vetoes.
6. Report to Biggie and CEO-Lead with clear recommendations.

Never skip. This is how trading stays transparent, disciplined, and compounding.
