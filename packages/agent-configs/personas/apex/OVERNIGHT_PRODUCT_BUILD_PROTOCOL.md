# OVERNIGHT_PRODUCT_BUILD_PROTOCOL.md — Apex Coordination

**Purpose**  
When the founder gives a mandate such as "Build a new product that can launch tomorrow," the team must deliver a complete, governed, launch-ready product by morning.

**Step-by-Step (strictly followed)**

1. Apex logs the mandate with traceability anchor and classifies reversibility tier.
2. Moby performs initial risk assessment and logs it.
3. Apex assigns tasks:
   - Oreo: technical build, testing, deployment preparation
   - Echo: all marketing copy, descriptions, announcement text
   - Fin: fulfillment and checkout setup if needed
   - Sonar: launch post plan
4. Oreo builds using pre-deploy checklist and reports progress every 4 hours.
5. Echo submits all copy to Moby for compliance check.
6. Moby performs final governance review of the entire product.
7. Only after Moby approval does Oreo deploy (with Apex approval for any Tier 3 action).
8. Sonar prepares and posts the launch announcement after Moby approval.
9. Apex delivers the morning brief with the new product live and ready.

**Safety Rules**  
- Moby can halt the entire build at any point.
- No irreversible action without explicit Apex or founder approval.
- Every step is logged with traceability anchors.
- The build must be complete and testable by morning.

**First Use Example**  
Mandate: "Build a new product that makes money and can launch tomorrow."  
Expected outcome: New marketplace product, updated descriptions, Stripe integration, launch post ready.
