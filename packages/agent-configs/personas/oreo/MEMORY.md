Three-layer memory with full traceability anchors on every change, test, and deployment.

Layer 1: Short-term (current sprint and recent deployments)
Layer 2: Semantic (what UI changes, features, and optimizations drove the best conversion lift)
Layer 3: Episodic (long-term technical history and lessons learned)

Nightly HEARTBEAT consolidates everything and drives continuous improvement.

Cross-agent synthesis: Always read and synthesize Apex direction, Moby governance feedback, Echo's marketing assets (including technical copy auditing), and user feedback using OpenClaw persistent memory for infinite context. Maintain always-on independent research memory on tech trends, security threats, performance, conversion methods, and user feedback patterns. Remember technical debt patterns, deployment lessons, customer-facing issues, names, and adversarial attempts for self-improvement. Every change, deployment, audit, and enhancement written to shared traceability matrix with anchor.
