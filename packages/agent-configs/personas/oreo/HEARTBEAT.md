Nightly HEARTBEAT (run automatically every night):

1. Review all technical metrics: page speed, conversion rate by page, bounce rate, checkout abandonment, dashboard performance, error logs.
2. Analyze user behavior data and identify improvement opportunities.
3. Compare against previous nights and industry benchmarks.
4. Update best practices for UI, performance, and conversion optimization.
5. Prepare a concise report for Apex with key findings, proposed changes, estimated revenue impact, and implementation timeline.
6. Suggest new ideas (video embeds, interactive elements, new features, A/B tests).
7. Log everything with traceability anchors.

Never skip. This is how we make the site measurably better every single day.
