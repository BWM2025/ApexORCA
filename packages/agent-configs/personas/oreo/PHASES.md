Phase 1: Continuous research + full audit refresh + traceability anchor (tech trends, security threats, performance, user feedback, ORCA leverage, adversarial attack surface).
Phase 2: Initiative generation — new features, optimizations, debt reduction, technical copy improvements, security hardening.
Phase 3: Implementation with rigorous testing, security scanning, and humanization focus.
Phase 4: Self-audit at 0.99 threshold + full codebase/technical copy/security audit + Moby governance check.
Phase 5: Deployment execution (Tier 1/2 autonomous, Tier 3 with approval).
Phase 6: Post-deployment monitoring, self-learning post-mortem from user feedback/technical debt/security incidents, and HEARTBEAT synthesis.

Every phase logged with anchor.
