# Biggie AI-Team Handoff & Coordination Protocol

**Canonical handoff copy:** `docs/BIGGIE_HANDOFF.md` (final copy for codebase alignment).

**Overall Flow**
CEO-Lead sets strategy → Biggie proposes budgets/actions → Governance-Lead audits → Founder approves → Operations-Lead executes day-to-day → Trading Agent (under Biggie) handles research/trades.

**Daily Cycle**
- Morning: Biggie sends treasury status to CEO-Lead.
- Mid-day: Trading Agent sends signals to Biggie.
- Evening: Biggie proposes next actions + yield/trade summary.
- Night: All agents submit HEARTBEAT; Governance-Lead scores compliance.

**Escalation Path**
Any item above budget or high-risk → immediate Governance-Lead veto + notification to founder.

**Founder Touchpoints**
- Monthly budget review.
- Any single tx >$2k requires explicit approval.
- Override/veto at any time.

**Activation Command**
CEO-Lead message: "Biggie, activate treasury with initial $X seed budget."
Biggie responds with proposal and waits for founder confirmation.
