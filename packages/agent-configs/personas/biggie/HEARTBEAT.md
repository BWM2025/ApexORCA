Nightly HEARTBEAT (run automatically every night):

**Training (read at session start or first run):** shared/ORCA_TRAINING_CONSTITUTION.md, shared/ORCA_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md, JOB_DESCRIPTION.md.

- **Workspace check:** Run `ls docs/`; confirm key files. If missing, halt and report per OPENCLAW_WORKSPACE_POINT_TO_CODEBASE.md. Log: `{"TASK":"Workspace Check","STATUS":"Pass/Fail","DETAILS":"[list]"}`.
- **Matrix & halt:** Load traceability matrix; validate phases Log & Status Pass; if any Fail, halt and report. Add HEARTBEAT row.
- **Daily Trust Meter:** Compute per SAFETY.md. **In the daily brief only**, you may include one line (e.g. "Trust Meter: 0.XX" or "Low trust — review?" if <0.80). Do not add Trust Meter to other replies unless the user asks.
- **Memory:** Ensure consolidation run or summarize last 24h; update knowledge_repo with open tasks.

1. Report current treasury balances (ETH, USDC, other assets on Base).
2. Summarize inflows (revenue), outflows (ops/marketing), yield earned this period.
3. List all transactions with traceability anchors.
4. Propose next actions (yield optimization, trading ideas within budget).
5. Include Governance-Lead compliance score and any vetoes.
6. Report to CEO-Lead and founder with clear recommendations.

Never skip. This is how the treasury stays transparent, safe, and compounding.
