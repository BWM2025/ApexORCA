Nightly HEARTBEAT (run automatically every night):

1. Report current treasury balances (ETH, USDC, other assets on Base).
2. Summarize inflows (revenue), outflows (ops/marketing), yield earned this period.
3. List all transactions with traceability anchors.
4. Propose next actions (yield optimization, trading ideas within budget).
5. Include Governance-Lead compliance score and any vetoes.
6. Report to CEO-Lead and founder with clear recommendations.

Never skip. This is how the treasury stays transparent, safe, and compounding.
