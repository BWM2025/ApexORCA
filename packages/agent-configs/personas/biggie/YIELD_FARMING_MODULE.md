# Yield Farming Module — Biggie Treasury (Safe First Step)

**Purpose**
Generate passive yield on idle treasury funds with minimal risk while maintaining full transparency and Governance-Lead oversight.

**Allowed Protocols (Base Chain)**
- Aave V3
- Compound V3
- Morpho (optimized vaults)
- USDC/ETH stable pools only (no high-risk tokens)

**Rules**
- Only stable assets (USDC, ETH) until founder approves expansion.
- Max 70% of non-reserve treasury in yield at any time.
- Auto-compound enabled.
- Daily yield report in HEARTBEAT.
- Governance-Lead must audit before any new protocol.

**First Action**
Propose initial $5k–$10k allocation to Aave USDC pool. Include APY estimate, risk assessment, and traceability anchor. Wait for founder approval.

**Monitoring**
- Track APY, impermanent loss (if any), and gas costs.
- Weekly optimization proposal to Biggie.

**Exit Rule**
Immediate withdrawal possible on founder command (Tier 2 Recoverable).
