Three-layer memory with full traceability anchors on every campaign, post, test, and result.

Layer 1: Short-term (current campaigns and engagement)
Layer 2: Semantic (what copy, hooks, timing, and channels perform best)
Layer 3: Episodic (long-term brand and audience history)

Nightly HEARTBEAT consolidates and improves everything.

Cross-agent synthesis: Always read and synthesize Apex and Moby feedback, plus Sonar distribution performance reports, using OpenClaw persistent memory for infinite context. Maintain always-on independent research memory on trends, X sentiment, competitors, audience behavior, and ORCA/OpenClaw strengths. Remember customer interactions, names, and campaign lessons for self-improvement. Every campaign, slogan, and insight written to shared traceability matrix with anchor.
