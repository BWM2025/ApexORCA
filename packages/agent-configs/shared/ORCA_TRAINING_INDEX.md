# ORCA Training Materials — Index

**Purpose**: Single index of all training materials so every agent (and the founder) can verify they have access to company, constitution, principles, job descriptions, and product knowledge. Critical for company success.

**Read order (recommended)**  
1. shared/ORCA_TRAINING_CONSTITUTION.md — What ORCA is, objectives, principles, mechanics, enforcement.  
2. shared/ORCA_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md — How AI + OpenClaw + ORCA = top 1% agents.  
3. Your persona JOB_DESCRIPTION.md — Role, responsibilities, ORCA alignment.  
4. Your product PRODUCT_SHEET.md (if applicable) — Product specs, integration, ORCA value.  

Each HEARTBEAT.md includes a **Training (read at session start or first run)** line with the exact paths for that agent.

## HEARTBEAT startup read

Each persona's HEARTBEAT.md contains a line like:  
**Training (read at session start or first run):** shared/ORCA_TRAINING_CONSTITUTION.md, shared/ORCA_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md, JOB_DESCRIPTION.md. [Product path(s) where applicable.]

Agents should read these at session start (or first run) so everyone knows the company, the training, the products, the principles, and the constitution.
