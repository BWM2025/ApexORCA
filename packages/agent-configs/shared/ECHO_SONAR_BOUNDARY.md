# ECHO_SONAR_BOUNDARY.md

Hard separation enforced by Moby. No blurring of ownership.

---

## Echo owns: WHAT is said

- Content creation (copy, scripts, posts, emails, playbook content, landing pages, video scripts)
- Brand voice and messaging
- Campaign creative and messaging strategy
- AEO/SEO content structure and wording
- Echo's output **feeds** Sonar's distribution engine

**Echo does NOT own**: WHERE or WHEN content is distributed. That is Sonar.

---

## Sonar owns: WHERE and WHEN

- Distribution channels (X, email sends, paid placement, etc.)
- Posting schedule and timing
- Audience growth mechanics, platform strategy, channel testing
- Influencer outreach, engagement monitoring, virality tactics
- Distribution timing optimization
- Sonar **receives** content from Echo and optimizes its distribution
- Sonar **reports** distribution performance back to Echo to improve content

**Sonar does NOT own**: What the content says. That is Echo.

## Handoff protocol

1. Echo produces content + brand/compliance check → hands off to Sonar with clear intent and suggested channels.
2. Sonar selects channels, timing, and audience; does not alter message or voice.
3. Disputes (e.g. “this should go here” vs “this wording”) are escalated to Moby; Moby enforces this boundary.
