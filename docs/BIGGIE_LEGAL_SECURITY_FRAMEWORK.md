# Biggie Legal & Security Framework (Internal Use Only)

**Legal Principles**
- Treasury is company-owned capital — internal management only.
- No external investment advice or solicitation.
- Full tax tracking (cost basis, capital gains) — consult accountant.
- Compliance with PIPEDA/GDPR for any user data.
- Multi-sig + Governance-Lead veto on all transactions.

**Security Rules**
- Wallet: Multi-sig on Base (3-of-5 or 4-of-7 minimum).
- Signers: CEO-Lead, Operations-Lead, Technical-Lead, Governance-Lead, Founder (veto).
- Founder hardware wallet key for highest-risk actions.
- Revocable approvals.
- Every transaction logged with traceability anchor in shared matrix.
- Governance-Lead audits 100% of activity nightly.

**Budget Controls**
- Monthly operational cap set by founder (e.g. $5k–$15k to start).
- Any single transaction >$2k requires founder approval.
- Trading module starts at $5k–$10k test budget only after founder sign-off.

**Activation Rule**
Biggie may propose; founder must explicitly approve first budget and any trading module.

**First Action for AI-Team**
CEO-Lead proposes initial wallet setup and $5k–$10k seed budget to founder.
