# ApexORCA Token — Smartest Plan (FELIX Model + Legal)

**Purpose:** Use the $FELIX playbook (community-associated, not founder-issued) to plan the ApexORCA token in a way that’s smart and legally careful.

---

## 1. What the $FELIX model tells us

**How $FELIX was done**

- **Created by:** Anonymous community (meme-token experience), *not* by Nat Eliason or the FelixCraft AI.
- **Association:** Token is *tied to* FelixCraft through narrative (AI agent story, “Felix the Cat” lore), viral X marketing, and dashboard integration.
- **Founder role:** Nat promotes and posts about it; FelixCraft site *tracks* $FELIX (treasury, fees, burns). Origin is clearly **community-led**; the project *associates* with it rather than *issuing* it.
- **Tech:** Base, ERC-20, launchpad-style, burns/fees to agent wallet. Meme token with narrative, not a “we built the protocol” claim.
- **Result:** Listed on XT, WEEX, BingX; tracked on FelixCraft dashboard; ~$2.59M market cap (Mar 2026). Framed as community extension, not official FelixCraft issuance.

**What this means for ApexORCA**

- You don’t have to *be* the token issuer. A **community or third party** can deploy the token; ApexORCA **associates** with it (narrative, tracking, optional fee design).
- **Separation of roles** is the key: “Community launched a token tied to the Apex Orca story; we track it and integrate it.” That mirrors FELIX and is the smartest structural move.
- **Naming:** We already decided: name **ApexORCA**, symbol **APEX** or **APEXO** (not ORCA). That stays.

## 2. Smartest plan for ApexORCA token

**Option A — Community / third-party launch (recommended; FELIX-style)**

1. **Who deploys:** Someone other than B.W. Moore / ApexORCA the company (e.g. anonymous community, partner, or a separate wallet not labeled “ApexORCA official”). Token is deployed on Base (launchpad or Remix), name **ApexORCA**, symbol **APEX** or **APEXO**.
2. **Narrative:** “Community launched $APEX / ApexORCA token tied to the Apex Orca AI governance story.” Storytelling on X, same way FELIX had a narrative. No claim that “ApexORCA issued this token.”
3. **ApexORCA’s role:** *Associate* only:
   - Track the token on apexorca.io (dashboard: price, treasury, fees if any), like FelixCraft tracks $FELIX.
   - Optional: fees from a pool or tokenomics go to a treasury wallet that the site displays (transparent).
   - Public language: “Community-launched token associated with the Apex Orca narrative; we track it here.” Not “we created” or “we issued.”
4. **You (B.W.) can promote** it like Nat did — posts, product coins, etc. — but the *origin* stays documented as community / third-party. That keeps the “we didn’t issue it” position clear.

**Option B — You deploy yourself**

- You (or ApexORCA) deploy the contract from your wallet. Then you’re the **issuer**. Still use name ApexORCA, symbol APEX/APEXO. Legally you’re more in the spotlight; keep all public language factual (no investment promises). Do the same dashboard tracking and transparency. When you have budget, a lawyer can advise on securities/consumer law in your jurisdiction.

**Recommendation:** Option A (community/third-party launch + ApexORCA associates and tracks) is the **smartest** — it aligns with the FELIX model, keeps issuance separate from the brand, and gives you a clear, honest story.

## 3. Legal guardrails (stay legal)

**Do this regardless of who deploys**

1. **No “we issued” if community deploys.** If Option A: never say “ApexORCA issued this token.” Say “community-launched token associated with Apex Orca” or “token tied to the Apex Orca narrative; we track it.”
2. **No investment promises.** Don’t promise profit, returns, or “investment.” Meme / narrative / community token framing only. No “buy this and you’ll make money.”
3. **Transparency on the site.** If you track the token: state clearly that it’s community-originated (or third-party), that you track it for transparency, and that you don’t guarantee any value or outcome.
4. **Naming.** Use **APEX** or **APEXO** (not ORCA). Already covered in `ORCA_TOKEN_NAMING_LEGAL_MEMO.md`.
5. **When you have budget:** Get a short legal opinion on (a) “community token + site tracking + promotion” in your jurisdiction, and (b) any securities or consumer-law risk. One-off consult is enough for now.

**If you deploy yourself (Option B)**

- Same as above, plus: don’t market it as an investment. Document that it’s a community/narrative token; you’re the deployer but not offering a security. Lawyer can refine wording when you can pay for it.

| **Model** | FELIX-style: token created by community/third party; ApexORCA *associates* (narrative, tracking), does not claim to *issue*. |
| **Name / symbol** | Name **ApexORCA**, symbol **APEX** or **APEXO**. (Already in `ORCA_TOKEN_LAUNCH_NOW.md` and naming memo.) |
| **Who deploys** | Prefer: community or third party. Alternative: you deploy; keep language factual and non-investment. |
| **Site** | Track token on dashboard (price, treasury, fees). State: “Community-launched; we track it.” No “we issued.” |
