# Product Refinements for v1 (Consumer Launch)

**Goal**: Keep all current products and prices exactly as they are.  
Optimize every description to clearly communicate **REAL Agency** — reliable, trustworthy, zero-drift agents that customers can actually use for real business.  
All descriptions follow Claude's proven structure for maximum clarity and conversion.

**Universal Rule**: Every product description must mention that ORCA Governance DNA is baked in (the wrapper only — never the internal team configs or secret sauce).

**FelixCraft.ai Blueprint Duplication + Improvement**:
- Templates (personas + skills) as downloadable products — Yes.
- Public live dashboard with real revenue/treasury/decisions as viral engine — Yes, already in codebase.
- Transparency for virality — Yes.
- Improvements we add: Full ORCA Governance DNA in every template (phase-locking, traceability, HEARTBEAT, reversibility tiers, veto enforcement).
- Post-launch additions by internal team: Autonomous X posting (Sonar/Echo), crypto treasury flywheel ($ORCA equivalent with buyback/burn).
- Claw Mart-style skill marketplace positioning — Yes (skills as "Skills for other agents").
- Human initial setup note — Included in Playbook for legal/compliance.
