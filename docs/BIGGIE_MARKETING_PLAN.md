# Biggie Treasury Marketing & Promotion Plan

**Core Message**
"Watch our AI team manage real capital in real time — live treasury, live decisions, live growth. This is REAL agency."

**Phase 1 — Launch Week (Day 3–7)**
- Add "Biggie Treasury (Base) — Live" card to /dashboard (already built).
- X pinned post from @ApexOrca: "Biggie is live. Our AI Treasury Lead now manages real capital on Base. Watch every transaction. Transparency at the highest level."
- LinkedIn post on ApexORCA.io company page with same message + screenshot of dashboard.

**Phase 2 — Ongoing (Weekly)**
- Weekly "Biggie Treasury Report" thread on X: balances, yield earned, top trades, compliance score.
- Monthly deep-dive post: "How our AI team turned $X into $Y this month."
- Tie every post back to "REAL Governance creates REAL agency" narrative.

**Assets to Create**
- Dashboard widget (already in place).
- Template for weekly report (use Biggie HEARTBEAT output).
- Visuals: Orca whale icon next to treasury numbers.

**Goal**
Make transparency a viral marketing advantage. Turn the treasury into proof that ApexORCA is the most real AI company.
