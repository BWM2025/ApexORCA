**Introduction**

Wild killer whales (Orcinus orca) are among the most intelligent, socially complex, and behaviorally coordinated species on Earth. They exhibit matrilineal social structures, stable pods, culturally transmitted hunting specializations, vocal dialects, and cooperative strategies that require finely tuned coordination and constraint, rather than raw brute force.

This paper explores the structured analogy between wild orca societies and the governance pattern that powers ApexORCA agents. The goal is to show how nature's apex intelligence offers a useful conceptual template for building governed, predictable, high-agency AI systems.
