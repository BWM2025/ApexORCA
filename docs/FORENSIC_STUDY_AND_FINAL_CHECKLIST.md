# PART 1: FORENSIC STUDY OF THE CODEBASE

## 1.1 Working files / files I may have created

| Check | Result |
|-------|--------|
| **CODEBASE_ALL_IN_ONE.md** (in repo) | **Does not exist.** It was created by mistake in docs/ and has been **deleted**. Only **APEXORCA_ALL_FILES_IN_ONE.md** at **workspace root** (ApexORCA.io FEB 2026) exists and is generated by `scripts/build-all-files-markdown.py`. |
| **MANIFEST_TREE.md** (in repo) | **Does not exist.** Same as above — deleted. Only **APEXORCA_FULL_MANIFEST_AND_TREE.md** at **workspace root** is the canonical manifest + tree. |
| **Any file named *copy*, *backup*, *temp*, *old*, *new*, *draft*, *working*** | **None** in source tree. Only `infra/backup.sh` exists (intended deploy/backup script). |
| **Any .bak or ~ backup files** | **None** found. |
| **References to deleted files** | **None.** No references to CODEBASE_ALL_IN_ONE or MANIFEST_TREE anywhere. |

**Conclusion:** No stray working files or duplicates from prior work. Single source of truth: workspace-root **APEXORCA_ALL_FILES_IN_ONE.md** and **APEXORCA_FULL_MANIFEST_AND_TREE.md**.

---

## 1.2 Duplicate READMEs or conflicting docs

| Item | Finding |
|------|---------|
| **Root README.md** | One only (`ApexORCA Code Base/README.md`). Project overview, deploy, env. |
| **content/playbook/README.md** | One only. Instructions for playbook.md + figures; required figure filenames. |
| **Product READMEs** | Each of the 7 product packages has exactly one **README.md** in its *-Complete folder (e.g. CEO-Pod-Complete/README.md). Each product also has **Diagrams/README.md** listing diagram filenames. **All intentional** — no duplication. |
| **Conflicting READMEs** | **None.** Different scope each (project vs playbook vs product). |

---

## 1.3 Two DEPLOY_NOW files — intentional, not conflicting

| File | Purpose | Clarification added |
|------|---------|---------------------|
| **DEPLOY_NOW.md** (repo root) | **Website** deploy: GitHub token, push, Vercel, env vars. Gets the **site** live. | Yes: one-line note at top: “This file: Getting the **website** live. For OpenClaw/agent setup, see docs/DEPLOY_NOW.md.” |
| **docs/DEPLOY_NOW.md** | **OpenClaw/agent** path: LLM API key, WhatsApp/Telegram, verify. “Zero-Cost Path.” | Yes: one-line note at top: “This file: OpenClaw/agent path. For **website** deploy, see DEPLOY_NOW.md at repo root.” |

**Conclusion:** Both are valid; they cover different workflows. Cross-references added so it’s clear which to use when.

---

## 1.4 Playbook: two sources, one PDF source of truth

| File | Role |
|------|------|
| **content/playbook/playbook.md** | **Single source for PDF.** Used by `scripts/export-pdf.ts`. Contains intro, TOC, all figure refs. |
| **docs/playbook.mdx** | Kept in sync for reference; same content. Export script does **not** use it. |

**Conclusion:** No conflict. PDF is built only from `content/playbook/playbook.md`. Figures: add 9 PNGs to `content/playbook/figures/` (names in `content/playbook/README.md`).

---

## 1.5 env.example

| Location | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| **ApexORCA Code Base/env.example** | Single env template at repo root. Includes NEXT_PUBLIC_URL, Stripe, Supabase, and LLM_PROVIDER comment. Copy to `apps/web/.env` per root README. |

**Conclusion:** One env example only; no duplicate or conflicting env templates.

---

## 1.6 INSTALL.md files

| Location | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| **packages/agent-configs/quickstart/install.md** | Single quickstart: WhatsApp/Telegram, LLM key, ref to LLM_PROVIDER_SETUP_GUIDE. |
| **Each product *-Complete/INSTALL.md** | Per-product install (e.g. CEO-Pod-Complete, Marketing-Pod-Complete). One per package. |

**Conclusion:** All intentional. Quickstart = global; product INSTALL = per-package.

---

## 1.7 Outdated or misleading text (fixed in this pass)

| File | Change made |
|------|-------------|
| **docs/FORENSIC_REVIEW_AND_DOMAIN_GUIDE.md** | Tree line for `playbook.md` previously said “ADD THIS”; updated to “Master playbook (source for PDF; intro, TOC, figures).” “Must-fix” line updated so it no longer says “Add playbook.md” (it exists); now says add figure PNGs if needed, replace Stripe test IDs, set production env. |

---

## 1.9 Full deep inspection process (syntax & bugs)

**Purpose:** Run a forensic, repeatable check of all file types for syntax and obvious bugs so nothing is missed.

### Steps (run in order)

| Step | What to run | Scope | Notes |
|------|-------------|--------|--------|
| **1. TypeScript** | `cd apps/web && npx tsc --noEmit` | All TS/TSX in apps/web | Catches type and syntax errors. If Node fails with dyld/libc++ (e.g. Mac OS mismatch), fix Node or use a CI environment. |
| **2. Next.js build** | `cd apps/web && npm run build` | Full app bundle | Catches TS, import, and runtime build errors. Same Node requirement as above. |
| **3. Lint** | `cd apps/web && npm run lint` | ESLint via next lint | Style and common bugs. |
| **4. Python** | `python3 -m py_compile scripts/build-all-files-markdown.py` | `scripts/*.py` | Validates Python syntax. |
| **5. Shell** | `bash -n <script>` for each `.sh` | All `.sh` in repo | Syntax-only (no execution). Scripts: quickstart `install-apex-as-main.sh`, `setup.sh`; infra `verify-setup.sh`, `apply-schema.sh`, `backup.sh`, `deploy.sh`; root `push-to-github.sh`; each product `*-Complete/setup.sh` and `apply-governance.sh`. |
| **6. JSON** | `python3 -c "import json; json.load(open('<file>'))"` for each | All `.json` (e.g. package.json, tsconfig.json, vercel.json, turbo.json, docs/APEXORCA_MASTER_SPEC.json, .vscode/*.json) | Valid JSON only; skip package-lock.json if desired. |
| **7. SQL** | Manual / Supabase apply | `infra/supabase-schema.sql` | Schema is applied at deploy; Supabase validates on apply. |
| **8. IDE lints** | Read Lints (or equivalent) on `apps/web` | TS/TSX/JS in apps/web | Use editor/IDE diagnostics for type and lint errors when CLI Node is unavailable. |

### Last run summary (syntax & validation)

| Check | Result |
|-------|--------|
| **Python** (`scripts/build-all-files-markdown.py`) | **OK** — `py_compile` passed. |
| **Shell** (all 14 `.sh` files) | **OK** — `bash -n` passed for every script. |
| **JSON** (9 files: package.json, tsconfig.json, vercel.json, turbo.json, docs/APEXORCA_MASTER_SPEC.json, .vscode/settings.json, .vscode/tasks.json, etc.) | **OK** — All valid JSON. |
| **SQL** (`infra/supabase-schema.sql`) | **OK** — Reviewed; standard PostgreSQL; apply at deploy. |
| **TypeScript / Next build / ESLint** | **Blocked** on this machine by Node dyld/libc++ (Node built for different macOS). **IDE Read Lints** on `apps/web`: **no linter errors reported.** |
| **Recommendation** | On a machine or in CI where Node runs correctly, run steps 1–3 and fix any reported errors; re-run until clean. |

### Additional checks run (everything possible without Node)

| Check | Result |
|-------|--------|
| **Python script execution** | **OK** — `python3 scripts/build-all-files-markdown.py` ran successfully; wrote `APEXORCA_ALL_FILES_IN_ONE.md`. |
| **Config files** | **OK** — `next.config.ts`, `postcss.config.mjs`, `tailwind.config.ts` present and structurally valid. |
| **Import resolution** | **OK** — All `@/` imports in apps/web point to existing files (lib/*.ts, components/**/*.tsx). |
| **Product ID consistency** | **OK** — Same 8 slugs in `lib/products.ts`, `lib/stripe.ts` (priceMap), `lib/downloads.ts` (productDownloads), and `scripts/generate-product-zips.ts` (PRODUCT_SOURCES + build functions). Marketplace shows 2 tabs only (Personas, Skills); no Bundles tab. |
| **Secrets scan** | **OK** — No hardcoded live secrets; only doc/example placeholders (e.g. `sk_live_...`, `whsec_...` in docs; `github_pat_xxxx` in push-to-github.sh). `env.example` uses placeholders only. |
| **FIXME / XXX / HACK** | **OK** — No critical FIXME/XXX/HACK in source; only package-lock integrity hashes and example text in scripts. |
| **Doc internal links** | **OK** — Links to FINAL_LAUNCH_NEEDS_LIST.md, LAUNCH_CHECKLIST_COMPLETE.md, LAUNCH_CHECKLIST.md verified; target files exist in docs/. |
| **IDE lints (full scope)** | **OK** — Read Lints on `apps/web` and `scripts`: no linter errors. |

**Safest manner:** Treat the checklist above as the forensic standard. Run it in a clean environment (e.g. fresh `npm ci` in apps/web if needed), fix any failures, then re-run until all steps pass. Use **APEXORCA_FULL_MANIFEST_AND_TREE.md** as the file list so no in-scope file is missed.

---

## 1.8 Summary of forensic study

- **No** working files or accidental duplicates left in the repo.
- **No** duplicate or conflicting READMEs; each README has a distinct role.
- **No** conflicting playbook sources for PDF; single source is `content/playbook/playbook.md`.
- **Two** DEPLOY_NOW files are intentional (website vs agent path); cross-links added.
- **One** env.example; one quickstart install.md; product INSTALLs are per-package.
- **Canonical** “all-in-one” and “manifest + tree” are **only** at workspace root: **APEXORCA_ALL_FILES_IN_ONE.md** and **APEXORCA_FULL_MANIFEST_AND_TREE.md**.

# PART 2: FINAL OPERATIONAL CHECKLIST — WHAT YOU MUST PROVIDE

**→ For the full, ordered launch checklist (all phases, testing, credentials for AI team, and “next 3 steps”), use the single source: [docs/FINAL_LAUNCH_NEEDS_LIST.md](FINAL_LAUNCH_NEEDS_LIST.md).**

The summary below mirrors that doc for quick reference. Tick items as you complete them.

---

## A. DOMAIN & HOSTING

| # | Item | What you provide / do |
|---|------|------------------------|
| A1 | **Production domain** | Confirm the live domain (e.g. **apexorca.io**). You must own it and point DNS to your host (e.g. Vercel). |
| A2 | **NEXT_PUBLIC_URL** | Set in production env (e.g. Vercel) to your canonical URL, e.g. `https://apexorca.io`. |
| A3 | **Host** | If using Vercel: repo connected, root directory **apps/web**, build and deploy working. |

---

## B. STRIPE (REQUIRED FOR LIVE SALES)

| # | Item | What you provide / do |
|---|------|------------------------|
| B1 | **Stripe account** | Live Stripe account (not test mode for production). |
| B2 | **STRIPE_SECRET_KEY** | Live secret key (`sk_live_...`) set in production env. Do not paste here; confirm it is set. |
| B3 | **STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET** | From Stripe Dashboard → Developers → Webhooks. Add endpoint URL: `https://apexorca.io/api/stripe/webhook` (or your live URL). Event: `checkout.session.completed`. Copy the **Signing secret** (`whsec_...`) into production env. |
| B4 | **Products & Prices in Stripe** | In Stripe (Live), create one **Product** and one **Price** (one-time) for each of the **8** items in the table in **docs/PRODUCTION_SETUP_WHAT_YOU_PROVIDE.md** (playbook, ceo-pod, marketing-pod, technical-pod, operations-pod, governance-booster, growth-engine, pod-os). |
| B5 | **Price IDs in code** | Replace every placeholder in `apps/web/lib/stripe.ts` → `priceMap` with your **live** Price IDs (`price_1...`). You can send me the 8 Price IDs and I can list the exact replacements, or you paste them and confirm when done. |

---

## C. SUPABASE (PURCHASE STORAGE)

| # | Item | What you provide / do |
|---|------|------------------------|
| C1 | **Supabase project** | Project created; schema applied (see `infra/supabase-schema.sql`). |
| C2 | **SUPABASE_URL** | Your Supabase project URL in production env. |
| C3 | **SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY** | Service role key in production env (server-only; never expose in client). |

---

## D. PLAYBOOK PDF (OPTIONAL BUT RECOMMENDED)

| # | Item | What you provide / do |
|---|------|------------------------|
| D1 | **Figure images** | If you want the playbook PDF to show diagrams: add the 9 images to `content/playbook/figures/` with exact names from `content/playbook/README.md` (apexorca-logo.png, figure-1-* through figure-8-*). |
| D2 | **Build PDF** | From repo root: `npx tsx scripts/export-pdf.ts`. Output: `apps/web/public/downloads/playbook.pdf`. Deploy so this file is served. |

---

## E. EMAIL (OPTIONAL)

| # | Item | What you provide / do |
|---|------|------------------------|
| E1 | **Transactional email** | If you want “download links sent to your email” after purchase: choose provider (Resend or SendGrid), verify sending domain (e.g. apexorca.io), provide **From** address (e.g. `noreply@apexorca.io`). I can wire the webhook → email and document the env var; you add the API key in production only. |
| E2 | **Contact / support email** | If you want a contact email on the site (footer, Privacy): provide the address (e.g. `support@apexorca.io`). No backend needed unless you want a form. |

---

## F. ACCOUNTS & CREDENTIALS (WHAT THE SITE DOES NOT NEED)

| # | Item | Note |
|---|------|------|
| F1 | **X (Twitter) / LinkedIn** | The **website** does not use X or LinkedIn API keys. You do **not** need to give me any X or LinkedIn credentials for the site to work. For your own marketing (posting from ApexORCA accounts), use X/LinkedIn directly or a scheduler. |
| F2 | **Grok / xAI** | For **running OpenClaw agents** (your own use), you add the Grok API key in OpenClaw config (see docs/LLM_PROVIDER_SETUP_GUIDE.md). Not stored in this repo. |
| F3 | **WhatsApp / Telegram** | Used by you with OpenClaw (QR scan, etc.). No account credentials go into this codebase. |

---

## G. REPO & DEPLOY

| # | Item | What you provide / do |
|---|------|------------------------|
| G1 | **GitHub** | Repo pushed; token with correct permissions if using Vercel GitHub integration (see root **DEPLOY_NOW.md**). |
| G2 | **Vercel env vars** | All of: NEXT_PUBLIC_URL, STRIPE_SECRET_KEY, STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET, SUPABASE_URL, SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY. Optional later: RESEND_API_KEY (or similar) if we add email. |
| G3 | **Build outputs** | Run `npx tsx scripts/generate-product-zips.ts` and (if applicable) `npx tsx scripts/export-pdf.ts` so `apps/web/public/downloads/` has the ZIPs and playbook.pdf before or during deploy. |

---

## H. CONFIRMATION (NO SECRETS IN CHAT)

| # | Item | What you do |
|---|------|-------------|
| H1 | **Stripe** | Confirm: “Live Stripe keys and webhook secret are set in production; I’ve added the 8 live Price IDs (7 products + playbook) to priceMap” (do **not** send the actual keys or IDs in chat if you prefer). |
| H2 | **Supabase** | Confirm: “SUPABASE_URL and SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY are set in production.” |
| H3 | **Domain** | Confirm: “NEXT_PUBLIC_URL is set to my live domain and DNS points to my host.” |

---

## QUICK REFERENCE: MINIMUM TO GO LIVE

1. **Domain:** NEXT_PUBLIC_URL = your live URL; DNS → host.  
2. **Stripe:** Live secret key + webhook secret in env; webhook endpoint = `https://apexorca.io/api/stripe/webhook`; all 8 Price IDs (7 products + playbook) in `apps/web/lib/stripe.ts` → `priceMap`.  
3. **Supabase:** SUPABASE_URL + SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY in env; `purchases` table created.  
4. **Build:** Product ZIPs + playbook PDF in `apps/web/public/downloads/` (run scripts as in G3).  
5. **Deploy:** Push and deploy (e.g. Vercel) with the env vars above.

Anything beyond that (email, contact address, figure PNGs) is optional for “operational”; the above is what’s **required** for the site to accept live payments and serve downloads.
