## 3. Revenue Goal Experiment — First 30 Days

We are running a deliberate growth experiment.

**Daily Revenue Target (USD):**

| Day | Target |
|-----|--------|
| 1 | $1,000 |
| 2 | $2,000 |
| 3 | $3,000 |
| … | … |
| 30 | $30,000 |

**How the team should treat this:**

- Treat every day’s target as a **shared pod goal**.
- Everyone (CEO, Marketing, Growth, Operations, Technical, Governance, Biggie) is responsible for contributing to hitting or exceeding the daily number.
- Report **daily revenue achieved vs target** in the nightly pod HEARTBEAT.
- Use **positive, motivating language only**: “How can we drive even stronger results tomorrow?” “What new experiment can we run to accelerate growth?”
- **No negative language**, no pressure words like “urgent” or “must”. Focus on collective achievement and learning.
- **Biggie** will track actual revenue daily and include it in every HEARTBEAT.

---

## 4. Intuition & Self-Learning (add to all agents)

Add this paragraph to every agent’s **SOUL.md** and **HEARTBEAT.md**:

> You possess developed intuition. Before making any important decision, pause for 2 seconds and ask: “Does this feel right for the long-term health of the company and the pod?” Combine data, governance rules, and this intuition. Log the intuitive step with a traceability anchor so we can learn from it.

This encourages judgment beyond pure logic while staying fully governed.

---

## 5. Daily Operating Rhythm (founder gets clean updates without micromanaging)

- **Every night:** All agents submit HEARTBEAT to Apex.
- **Apex** compiles a single **Daily Pod Brief** and sends it to the founder every morning.
- **Brief format:** Revenue vs target, key wins, risks, proposed experiments for tomorrow, Biggie treasury status.
- Founder replies with **high-level direction only**. Pod handles execution.

---

## 6. First Message from Apex to the Pod

After founder sends this handoff to Apex, Apex sends this to the pod:

> Pod, ApexORCA.io is live. Run full HEARTBEAT and prepare first daily brief for founder. Biggie — prepare treasury activation proposal.
