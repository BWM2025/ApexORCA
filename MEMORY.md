# MEMORY.md — Long-term continuity

**Purpose:** Curated memory for the pod. Update with decisions, lessons, and what matters. Daily files are raw; this is distilled.

## Workspace and credentials (2026-02-28)

- **One workspace:** OpenClaw workspace = this codebase. Everything (apps/, docs/, scripts/) is the same place. Credentials for the agent live in **openclaw.env** in the repo root (gitignored). Start the gateway with `bash scripts/start-openclaw-gateway-with-env.sh` so the agent gets those vars.
- **Handoff:** See **docs/HANDOFF.md** for what's in the workspace and what to do next. Update it when something changes.
- **Path has spaces:** Always quote the full path in scripts and exec (e.g. `"/Users/RECESS1/Desktop/ApexORCA.io FEB 2026/ApexORCA Code Base"`).
